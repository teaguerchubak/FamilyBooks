                Time went fast. It wasn't long until I had enough money to get to Denver. I had written to the V.A. for my needed requirements — the Government check to be mailed to Denver. It was the last week in May when we left Hardin. I had my traveling orders and was to enter the Hospital on either the 28th or 29th of May. It was only a two or three-hour drive from Hardin to Denver. I felt quite sure of the car this time, and even though I felt I had plenty of money, we spent none of it foolishly. My check would be in Denver by the time we got there. That would be enough for our expenses while there, and getting us back.

                And I had promised the Redmans that upon our return that way, we would look after their place for two weeks while they were on vacation. And so we started out again for Denver. We slept that first night in a cabin. It seemed that winter was starting all over again and we were in a big snowstorm. When we awakened that morning we found about a foot of snow on the ground. But at this time of year, the snow seemed to melt quickly.

                On our travel that first day we went through a village, I think was called “Fruitland” and fruit and shade trees were almost bare of leaves and branches just as though they had been pruned off. Large branches were strewn all around and some were so large that we had to drive around them. This storm caused so much destruction.

                (I am writing this part of my story in an apartment in San Diego, where the apartment was built on a corner lot at the top of a hill. There is a beautiful view of the suburbs day and night.
            </p>
            <p class="poem">
                There is a little low spot below this apartment and then the hillside, with a gentle sloping for miles, has many beautiful homes and office buildings. And as nature dims its lights from the heavens, the genius of mankind shows the twinkling of lights as if they float about in mid-air. No wonder this part of California is called the winter resort of the Southwest. And I acknowledge my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Mrs. Yehling who made this stay in San Diego possible; her prayers, kindness, and understanding. The song, “Count Your Many Blessings, Name Them One By One” applies to me. And I know that one's blessings can only be reached through honesty and decency.)

                Everyone is aboard now and we are leaving Fruitland, Wyoming. We made good time over the rolling hills even though the roads were muddy with melting snow. We thought we would drive to Cheyenne, stop for the night, and be in Denver by the next night. But fate plays tricks on one. When we were out in the desert, more than twenty miles from Cheyenne, the car made a growling noise and stopped.

                So we decided to spend the night by the side of the road. But after dark, cars went by and a man stopped his car and tried to get ours going. Then he said it would have to be pulled into a garage and he could do it but would first have to make one more stop in his job for an oil company. He attached a chain to our car and his, and after about ten miles down the highway he had to take a side road to make his last call. Then he unchained the cars after pulling ours to the side of the road. We got into his car and he drove for several miles through nothing but mud. How he managed to get there and back is almost a mystery. But we finally pulled into Cheyenne and were taken to a garage. The night worker looked it over and found what was wrong and said he had some used, but good parts and the car would be ready by morning. As for the oil company man, he would not take any pay. But I gave him three dollars toward gas.

                I was becoming worried about expenses; what if the car repair cost twenty dollars? Well, I would just have to leave it. I said to the boys, “We may have to walk to Denver.”
            </p>
            <p>
                That morning we headed for the garage in apprehension, thinking he might charge us fifty dollars. But after the man started telling a long story of what he had done on the car, he said the charge would be twelve dollars! The car was out in front and ready for us. Now the world seemed brighter. We would be in Denver that night.

                I only had a few dollars left but expected to receive my V.A. check in a few days. We had to find a cabin and some food and this kept running through my mind on that last day's trip. It was dark when we arrived in Denver. I wanted to find a cabin as close to the hospital as possible as I would have to walk as there was no money for bus fare. How grand it seemed being in that mile-high city. We had won out in spite of obstacles! We could forget the uncomfortable things because we had succeeded through our determination. I feel within myself that every one of us is blessed by some higher power. If we are deserving we are guided through some of the most difficult problems.
