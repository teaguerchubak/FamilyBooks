                In those early years, the country had many Greeks and Italians. On this job, though, one had to be a natural-born citizen. I was lucky being with my own age group and having friends. There was the 'straw boss' who had a new 16-gage shotgun which I bought from him for thirty dollars. But that left me broke for a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day when we were working, he said, “That looks like an eagle perched on that limb.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked up and said, “Yes, and he's sure a big one.”
            </p>
            <p>
                At that, he said, “I'll bet you five dollars against your safety razor that it's not a bird.”
            </p>
            <p>
                This 'bird' was at least a half mile away and to me, it still was a bird. So I made the bet. And right away the work stopped. We crossed the meadows and fences to get near enough to see what it was; ah, nothing but a big nest strewn over a limb to form an almost perfect bird shape. So I lost the bet.
            </p>
            <p>
                I lost more than that; my railroad job lasted less than a month because I became very ill with Yellow Jaundice. I was sent to a doctor in Salt Lake City. After a couple of days, it cleared up. But the doctor said the drinking water was the culprit. I should drink more coffee and less water. This put fear into me about that Southern Utah job. I had to report back to work. My bedding and shotgun were there. Now I had a worried mind and decided to quit. Should I quit, or should I stay with the job that I had wanted so much?
            </p>
            <p>
                How could I tell the boss I was going to quit; would he be angry with me? Or would he tell me I hadn't grown up yet?
            </p>
            <p>
                Would he say, “You're a sissy; you can't take it. And anyway, we don't like you.” Oh, what an imagination I had.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hadn't worked very long but long enough to know what a temper he had. And when he got wound up he exploded with a bang! I had several hours on the train in which to think and adjust myself to what lay ahead. I tried to console myself on one matter. If the boss showed me for a weakling I could easily quit.
            </p>
            <p>
                But to my astonishment everything worked out so different; I arrived back in Gunnison at supper time. I dreaded breaking the news to the boss. However, everyone including the boss was glad to see me. This good feeling toward me built me up to the point where I wondered whether I should quit. Or should I keep on working? But I had made up my mind and didn't change it. I quit and asked for my pay and a pass back to Salt Lake City.
            </p>
            <p>
                My boss didn't want me to quit; told me to forget it. But when he saw I was in earnest about quitting, he said he would have everything ready that evening.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went back to the bunk car and our bedroom and broke the news to the boys. They begged me to stay. But on the following morning I was headed out of there. And that was the end of my railroad career.
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, I needed help with my suitcase. It was so crammed with my bedding that one of the boys stood on it in order to get it buckled shut. Then I was on my way. And I arrived late Saturday evening. Here I was with no money. But I had a signed slip of paper by the B. & B. boss which I was to turn over to the timekeeper at the depot. Everything was closed until Monday morning, I found. But I was lucky; — I had that statement which proved to be good as cash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not too far from the depot was a restaurant with a sign of ROOMS FOR RENT. So I dropped in and showed the clerk that slip of paper. He approved and told me to sign that slip. He would put me up until Monday. That morning he cashed the slip and took out his amount for board and room. I was there four or five days before I went out on my new job of surface work for a mining company. My railroad check was so small I was almost broke again.
            </p>
            <p>
                A newspaper ad had work listed for six men at Montpelier, Idaho with railroad pass furnished, I read in an employment column. I had some extra time, so the next day I headed back to Idaho and a visit with Uncle Hyrum Stevenson's family. He was Supt. of school in Montpelier.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we arrived at the depot we were met by the man in charge. After loading our bedrolls and baggage into the wagon we were on our way; mile after mile of winding mountain road and we arrived at the camp. It was a very beautiful spot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever the horses went, the dog went as they were friends from the moment the dog was born. He paid no attention to other dogs nor to rabbits. And on the way back we picked up a coyote that followed us clear into camp. Oh, there were thousands of rabbits, sage hens, and so many wild things in this part of the country. And chickens came right around the camp.
            </p>
            <p>
                The job didn't amount to much and I was very disappointed when the works closed down. The boss was strong Republican and this was the election year of 1913. As soon as word got out that Woodrow Wilson had been elected president, everything closed down at that spot. I had enjoyed the work very much. And it was such beautiful country.
            </p>
            <p>
                But seeing that one couldn't live too long on scenery, my job came to an end and we loaded our bed rolls on the same old wagon and were left off at our starting place; Montpelier. At least I would have another visit with Uncle Hyrum.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found people to be friendly and talkative along the way. And I spent several days there with Uncle Hyrum and Aunt Mary. They lived just outside the little town of Montpelier. They had a wonderful view of the mountains. In the evenings one could see for miles over those rolling hills. Sagebrush was thick on them. And there were hundreds of white snowshoe rabbits hopping about. They reminded me of herds of sheep grazing on the hillside.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weather was colder each day and I wasn't dressed for it. But my short-term jobs had left me without enough money to buy clothes. So I shivered with what I had. I always kept in mind, though, that whenever I was really in need, I still had a home waiting for me with the Parrish family in Blackfoot. I knew it was time for me to be moving on and I had enough money to buy my train ticket there. It was too cold riding in a box car now. I told Uncle Hyrum I would return to work when there was any prospects opening up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to leave my stuff at Uncle's. Instead of the bother with bedding and that worn-out suitcase, I left everything except the shotgun. In Bingham County, there was sport ahead with duck hunting, rabbits, and sage hens. My spirits lifted and I felt happy as I boarded the train for Blackfoot.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was headed home! And even though broke, I had friends. There was dear old Ed, just about forty years old at that time. I was about twenty-one but Ed and I were friends. I knew he would share his bed with me. And I knew an extra chair would be added at the table. And I could hear the words, “We're glad you're back.” No wonder I called that part of the country home. Within twenty miles where I had worked on farms, I had found that sociability didn't just happen with the Parrish family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew this country well — every water hole, pond, and rolling, drifting sand hill. They were numerous in the country. In my younger years, I had done much trapping with boy friends, not only on the Blackfoot River area but in creeks and ponds throughout that county. I guess I grew up by nature's own hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                That expected wind was blowing when I stepped off the train. It was much colder there than in Montpelier. Southeastern Idaho is noted for its drifting sand and tumbling tumbleweeds. And it is second to none when it comes to wind storms. Wyoming can boast of gentle winds as the song goes, “Cheyenne, Cheyenne, hop on my pony.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Doesn't that song of gentle winds blowing make one sort of homesick to be back in old Wyoming? But as to gentle winds, let's not take that literally. We know the winds in Wyoming are as well known and just a sneak-in from her sister state, Idaho!
