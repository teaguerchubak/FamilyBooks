                My early life was spent much different from what most children experience. Sometimes I was with Grandma Stevenson in Cottonwood and other times with Mother in Idaho. But whichever place I was at the moment, being a child I enjoyed it. I think children played much the same then as they do today.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those days the biggest thing in life anywhere was farming. Anyone who owned a farm or ranch was well looked upon. We small boys had our play farms even to ditches with real water running in them. We always had six to eight horses which we made from birch willows. We had them all named and we straddled over the willows and away we'd go.
            </p>
            <p>
                My memory has much improved since the age of six when I entered the first year of school. As to my schooling, those days were very short as I disliked even the sight of a school building. At my age, I would rather look at a nice thriving garden or a beautiful flower bed than at the finest school building ever built. I would rather use what manual strength I have, working in the garden or woods. Even writing my life story is much harder than pitching dirt from a basement.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember my first school teacher and her name was Tilley Watts. Perhaps her real given name was Matilda. She disliked that name, Tilley. And it wasn't long before the older boys got wise to that and tormented her. They never let up. They would go out of their way to say, “Is Tilley well today?” — or “Does Tilley need any help tending the babies? If so, call on us, Tilley.” That really “boiled” her. She was just a young girl, maybe eighteen or nineteen, quite small, but nevertheless a bundle of dynamite. But she only taught one term and then quit.
            </p>
            <p>
                At one time she had me stand in front of the school kids for some mischief I had done. I guess it was for chewing paper. I don't remember exactly, but I must have been guilty. She stood beside me tearing off strips of newspaper, cramming them into my mouth with her fingers. I survived.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next school term was different. Jessie Freniman, or Trenimum, an older lady, was the teacher. She was a perfect lady and a Catholic. This seemed strange to me having a Catholic teaching in a Mormon community. I reached the third grade without flunking, so I bestow this honor upon myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                But looking back, my school days were very short and I don't remember whether I reached the 4th grade or not. My dislike of school gives me a worthy cause to say that I have forgotten. I'll never know how I kept out of school, though. Maybe those few years of high learning in school and my hatred of it, made me determined not to continue. But at this writing, I don't feel proud of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were some things at Grandma's that weren't always pleasant, as one would expect at a grandma's. Grandma Stevenson was very strict; so much so that we kids would never tell her anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought she was aging quite fast. But I was young. And when I think of Grandma Stevenson, born so long ago, 1841, or of Grandpa Stevenson who died when I was just five years old, in 1897, perhaps I did not take into consideration how tired and weary Grandma must have been many times — not only with caring for her own large family for so many years, but mother's as well. Surely we were an added burden to her already overworked life. In those days there was nothing automatic. Everything for that large family had to be done by hand. When I say things weren't always pleasant for us there, perhaps we were very blessed having a home to live in down in Cottonwood, because much of our life down there was wonderful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being young, I could see only my own life and some things were not to my liking, like being in bed promptly at 8:00 P.M. each night. And I had to stay there until eight the next morning. This left me with one half hour to get ready for school, and in addition, I had to run over to Uncle's for a pitcher of cream for Grandma's tea. He lived about two city blocks from us. Sometimes I even had to split some kindling. All these things had to be done in one half hour. The school was between one and two miles from Grandma's. I am sure I had to run all the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was one winter that Harold, who was about three and a half years older than I, was at Grandma Stevenson's. He considered himself a good fist fighter. There was another boy who was the best fighter in the school. Almost every night these boys would get together for a fight. This went on for weeks. I was the one who suffered most. I was so frightened and so afraid that Harold would get hurt. I used to wish another school day would never come. But the next day always came.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was seldom that any neighbors dropped in to visit Grandma. But I can think of but one time when some ladies came over. But Harold and I didn't get to see them. Grandma rushed us into the clothes closet and shut the door. There may have been reasons but I don't remember. Perhaps in this large Stevenson family there was plenty of company without inviting neighbors over. But there were never any neighbor children who came to play, and we never went to their homes. This was so different from our life as we lived in Idaho as a close-knit group of neighbors and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the Stevensons, my favorite cousin was Harry. He was a wonderful lad and he always took my part. We never had any disagreements. He was about the same age as Harold, and about four years older than I. Wherever Harry was, in work or play, I was there. The children in those days used to ride, and drive horses at a very young age. Uncle Henry had a mail route. That left Harry the only boy in the family to take over the farm work. Autumn was the happiest time of the year for us. We had to haul in the winter coal.
            </p>
            <p>
                And there was the wheat to be hauled to the grist mill and bring it back as sacks of flour. What a thrill it was to see the big water wheel turn all those many belts and see with our own eyes, and feel ourselves trembling with the rumbling of the building. The power of the belts turning changed the kernels of wheat into soft fluffy flour right before our eyes. Oh, those were the wonderful days! And those memories are so dear to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of our uncles had several stands of honey bees. Harry and I got into much mischief at times. Harry had been playing close by. A bright idea struck us and we started throwing sticks and stones at a beehive. Just about the time we were having the most fun, one of us looked up to see Uncle Hyrum.
            </p>
            <p>
                He had just passed a brush pile and he picked up a stick and said, “Now, boys, you've had your fun and now it's my turn. Rather than using the stick on you, you boys are going to bring back all the ones you have thrown.”
            </p>
            <p>
                His word was law. We made several trips back and forth. But lucky for us, neither of us got stung.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another time we got into trouble. We couldn't resist the temptation of catching fish. They were in a pond across the road from Grandma's home. Harry had tried to catch some fish with hook and line. But they wouldn't bite. So we took off our shoes and waded in after them. It was summer and the cold water felt good. But we didn't catch any fish with our hands, either. It wasn't long before that nice clear spring water was all muddy. Then those big fish came to the top and we got a nice catch, which we divided. Harry went home with his fish and I took mine happily in to Grandma. I thought she would be pleased that we had caught such nice fish. But she was really angry and she sent me upstairs without any supper. She told me not to come down until morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a ditch from that pond with water running down the North side of Grandma's home. This water was what was used in the house. And now it was riled! When Mother was here, this ditch was her pride and joy. Mother had a hand in it, as one would say. Mother couldn't get the boys out there to start digging, so she got busy one day. She started digging with only such tools as a woman would use. When the boys saw how determined she was to have that ditch, and the water from the pond, they took over the job and did it.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most interesting things at Grandma's was the old-fashioned well, boarded on the North side. It had a neat roof on top. It had a large wheel type pulley. And as a youngster, I will always remember a picture on the wall in the parlor, of a well just like this one outside our door. It fascinated me. It was supposed to have been on the very spot where the composer, Wardsworth, standing by that well, got the inspiration for writing the beautiful never-to-be-forgotten song, “The Old Oaken Bucket.” Everyone knew this song. And the pages of time have gone much too fast. But even as a youngster about six years old, I always loved the singing of music. I loved hearing the folks singing those beloved songs around the piano in the evenings at Grandma's. “The Old Oaken Bucket” was often sung. And that song touched so many things of my own childhood. I think of this old well. It brings a sadness to me just thinking of uncles and aunty taking their places beside the piano and singing this old favorite. Those times are gone never to be brought back except in memory; memory of the green meadows, the ponds, and the wildflowers that thrived in abundance, and the well.

            <p class="poem">
                How dear to my heart are the scenes of my childhood<br>
                When fond recollections presents them to view.<br>
                The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wildwood<br>
                And every loved spot which my infancy knew.<br>
                The wide spreading pond and the mill that stood by it;<br>
                The bridge and the rock where the cataract fell.<br>
                The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it.<br>
                And e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well.<br>
                The old oaken bucket, the iron bound bucket<br>
                The moss covered bucket which hung in the well.

                Many a night music was the joy to all of us as Aunt Hattie played the piano and three of my uncles sang. It was a real treat listening to them. I settled down in the old-fashioned rocker and enjoyed every minute of the beautiful singing. The brothers and Hattie had sung and played on programs in public many times.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the evening passed, the cookie jar was placed in the center of the table for us to help ourselves. Grandma was an excellent cook. She was very fine in her position in the home; as proficient a mother and homemaker as were the singers around the piano in their home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was just a listener in these sing-times. And as the night wore on, my eyes got smaller. I was then willing to walk up those many steps of that long stairway. As I neared the top my fears were deeper, but only because of that big clothes closet at the head of the stairs. There were spooks up there. I knew that because I had heard them. I had looked in that clothes closet in the daylight. But no self-respecting spook would dare to stay there during the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I reached the bedroom and closed the door and got into bed, the stillness of night was broken by the music below. But that couldn't keep me awake long as I was so very tired. The music went on to midnight. And when I awoke in the morning the evening before seemed like a dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weddings in the Stevenson family were family affairs. And for us boys, they were really special times. We had been warned not to come into the house until we were called. So after several hours of play, we were invited for supper. And what a supper it was! — everything we wanted was passed to us. Our new aunty made sure we had plenty to eat. I don't remember seeing any of my cousins there, but maybe my memory is a bit rusty.
            </p>
            <p>
                With morning, other interesting and happy times took over. Harry Stevenson and I had trained a young calf to pull a little wagon. One had to lead and the other rode the wagon. It must have been quite a sensation as Aunt Hattie took our picture — us, and the calf. And we had lots of fun over it many times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harry had a paper route the year round and he always had money. He even had credit at one of the stores where we bought candy. Many times I went with him. The paper routes then were much farther than those of today. He used to saddle a horse and we rode for miles and miles; sometimes doubled up on the same horse. And Harry always had candy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time went on and there was a music school started by Evan Stephens as teacher. He was one of the greatest songwriters in the Church at that time. He charged twenty-five cents for each child and he always had a full class. At that time he taught singing, and my cousins and I took lessons for several months. Harry was the oldest boy so he did the driving. It was in a two-seated buggy called a “surrey.” And at least eight or ten of us rode with him each week during the summer. We were a happy crowd and we rode without mishap, all these young people.
