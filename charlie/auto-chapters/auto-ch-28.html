                When we drove into the city of Hardin we stopped there for the night and then into Buffalo, Wyoming the following day. This was our stopping place for at least a week while waiting for permission to enter the V.A. Hospital in Denver. Not knowing the government rules nor waiting for anything, I made a mistake as I did not know the regulations of a veteran. I should have reported to the V.A. in Helena, Montana that I was ready for whatever papers were needed for the trip to Denver, and entrance to the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
                The week stretched into two and I had rented the cabin for just one week. We hadn't been very careful in the way we spent our money and I would have to pay for that extra week rent. We had eaten well, drove the car each day, fishing and sightseeing. With our board, rent, and gas, my pockets were really flat. And toward the end of the week, I had to dig deep to find even pennies. We were miles from Denver, and miles from home. And we were too broke to even try to get to Denver.
            </p>
            <p>
                I must find work and earn money for gas and food. I received the V.A. letter letting me know that from now on I was to let “Uncle Sam” do all the thinking and planning just as in war days. I was told to either return to Montana or else get in touch with the V.A. in Wyoming; that meant two more weeks delay.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so we returned to Hardin, Montana, not in the happiest mood. But we were discouraged. I had so small amount of money that I knew I would have to find some kind of work and find it soon. I began to inquire about work. I found this to be a farming community. At this time of year, there was no work at all. I did get worried then. We were away from home — broke, and in a strange city. And we needed a cabin and food. We needed no sympathy, nor gifts, but just plain honest work. But where could I find any work? I looked through the want ads in the newspaper. I came across one item that said, “Elderly man wanted for chores at board and some wages. Call evenings at the Sugar Factory and ask for Mr. Redman.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, wonderful! — I felt sure of that job; so sure that my worries vanished. I just knew he would put me to work.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so in my mind, I hired myself out hours before I was hired. Toward late afternoon the next day, we drove out to the factory, parked the old car right at the door, and marched into the building. We didn't look it, but to see us walk, we pretended the three of us were officials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three men were working and we found out they were foremen who worked all year round. But they let us wait several minutes before shutting off the machine. Then one pointed to a man “right over there working on that welder” and I introduced myself and sons. I asked for the job. He said he needed a man — not the whole family; then he started to work again. But we just stood there. He didn't look up for five minutes. But I was so desperate I wasn't going to budge until I explained things 'other than the whole family.' To me, the boys became a minus, considering we had ten in our family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, Mr. Redman stopped, took off his helmet, and asked,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Have you worked on a farm?” — He named all the things that needed doing. I said I could do them. So he gave me directions to his farm and said to come out that evening so things could be talked over with his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
                We went back to our cabin and checked out and loaded things in the car. We did not stop for supper but went on our way to the ranch. It was almost dark when we rode into the yard.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were invited into the house. After a half hour, I was given the job with the agreement that I would work for one dollar a day. And I was to board myself and the boys, but they would furnish all the eggs, milk, and bread that we needed. Oh, how happy we felt! We now had a job.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was dark now. With the aid of the lantern, we were shown our living quarters which consisted of a granary, so cluttered that it took an hour to make room for our three army cots.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the following day, I earned my first dollar. I really earned it, too, with hoe, shovel, broom, mop, digging, and sweeping and mopping up this unbelievable scramble. It became more livable, excepting for the roof which leaked like a sieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began to get used to the work I was to do. And as we got acquainted with Mrs. Redman, she furnished us with cooked meals. This surely helped me out, as with ten hours work I didn't have much time to cook. And as time went by, we found ourselves part of the family, seated at their table. Sometimes this was for three meals, and at times once a day. There were four children home, and like all children — they hated to do dishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Redman didn't feel well, and I kept Steven with me. And after supper, we did the dishes. There were twin girls big enough to do most of the housework but they didn't see it that way. Just like most mothers, she found it easier to do the work herself. Whatever I could do in the evenings, I was happy to do. When the evening prayer was said, we knelt down, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our desperate situation until now, I felt it a privilege and godsend to prove our worth. And it didn't take long for Keith to fit in their home helping Mrs. Redman do the washing each week. He became a great favorite with her. The wash water had to be hauled. A fifty-gallon wood barrel was arranged on a sort of one-horse sled. Then it was pulled to the wash house the day before. And the wood stove was also made ready with kindling in it ready for the striking of the match. Keith helped with the washing. Steven just played around.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work consisted of about everything: irrigating — to making headgates for ditches, keeping down the weeds from the big garden, and many other things. I worked hard ten hours a day.
