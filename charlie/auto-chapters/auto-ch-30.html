                We were now in Denver but didn't know whether we were going North, South, East, or West, and we did not know where the hospital was. So we drove into a gas station to get our bearings on the city. The man said there was a tourist camp just a few blocks farther. So we went there and I felt more like a beggar than myself, because I wanted always to pay our way. And I only had the money for a two-day stay. But I thought something might turn up.

                I told the lady in charge of the cabins, who we were, why we were in Denver, and that we might be there for a week or two. But I could only pay for two days. And soon after the first of June my check would be there and I could pay the rest. She never said 'no, nor yes,' but showed me the cabin.

                It was snowing again and cold. I had walked over to the hospital only to be told that the doctors were off the job for the holidays as this was the day before Memorial Day. And the doctor in charge of me would be off for four days; this made our condition worse, financially. Every day we went to the post office and asked if there was any mail for me. There never was. And it was a long way to the P.O. and at first we rode the bus those two or three miles; then we had to walk back as our money was gone. But I had expected my check.
            </p>
            <p>
                I told the lady at the tourist camp about our situation and she told me we could stay right there until I could pay. When we were about to eat the last of our food, Steven was putting the bowl of soup on the table and it fell to the floor. Something had to be done now.
            </p>

                I walked to the little corner store and asked for credit. The owner was impatient and didn't seem to be listening to my story as he went right on with his work. But then he said, “Yes, get what you need.” Those were the kindest words spoken throughout our trip; they didn't seem real. I was so taken aback, that it took me seconds before I started shopping for the few things that I bought. My purpose in coming to the store was to ask for credit, but I didn't expect it in Denver, but I couldn't just sit down without trying. The woman who owned the cabins said she had learned all this the hard way; everybody for himself, and the devil for us all!
            </p>
            <p>
                As to my grocery deal, had I only had enough money for a loaf of bread, that is all I would have taken home. But it seemed like the grocerman had almost handed over the keys to the store to a stranger. I was completely broke. He asked no questions nor set any time for payment. I knew my bill would be paid, but he didn't. If he had explained how he did his business deals, I would have understood. I dare not think what might have happened had it not been for the kind and thoughtful help of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                All through this life story, when I needed help, it became a reality. Perhaps sometimes we fail to see the good things in life. Instead, we pick out our misfortunes. And one can't build strength, courage, and honesty, through hate, fear, and greed. We should bury our grouch, whatever the cause, and look on the bright side of things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neither Keith nor Steven were old enough to grasp the full meaning of why this or that. But I can say with pride that there never were any better-behaved boys in every way than Keith and Steven. At any time they fit in with everybody and everything. They even hungered without complaint. The success of our trip can be well understood when we think of their decency and good behavior. I didn't quite understand nor did I doubt that the trip to Denver and return was taken care of at times by some higher power than I possessed myself. Whenever we needed help, it was cheerfully furnished, just as though it had been arranged that way months ahead.
