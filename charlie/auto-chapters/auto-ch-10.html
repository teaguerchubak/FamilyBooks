            <p>
                About this time I decided to buy a saddle horse for myself. The road leading to the Indian Reservation passed in front of the George Parrish home. Many Indians would be passing by and I would make a deal with an Indian for a horse. This was Saturday and I believe every Indian in that part of the reservation would make his trip into Blackfoot.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so I settled down by the roadway, waiting. That sounds queer — waiting — one seldom waits for anything anymore. But we were relaxed in those days. I had only ten dollars so would have to settle for a bronc. But I didn't mind. The one I got only weighed about seven hundred pounds. But he had ten pounds of meanness to every pound of flesh. I might become in time, the best bronc rider in the state of Idaho, with the help of Ed.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was summer and not even a breeze was blowing. We had the bronc saddled and Ed had tamed him down a bit. Now come along with me in retrospect, and let us walk up on high ground. This will give us a better view of the country. Right where we stand we can see for miles and the road is straight. You are looking at the only road leading to the old Fort Hall, one of the oldest army camps established in earlier days. This is on the Indian Reservation. This road hasn't always been here. But in later years it was built on the sexton line and a bridge was built over the Blackfoot River. I worked for several years for the Indian who owned that part.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my day for “proving” myself. As we look up we see Ed and he is having a time getting the bronc steady, as it lunges ahead and then back. Look out, Ed, or your riding days will be over. And while I'm too afraid of owning up to it, I still have to ride that horse. But I said to Ed,
            </p>
            <p>
                “You are a good rider, Ed, and if you ride him it will do away with all this snubbing and extra work you are doing.”
            </p>
            <p>
                His face brightened and thinking of the fun he would be missing, he said, “Why me? You're scared, aren't you? I wouldn't ride that pint of soap. It would be a disgrace to the broncobuster's world.”
            </p>
            <p>
                That settled it; I must be the rider. I think he was as frightened of that horse as I was. An experienced rider never looks for the soft spot to fall. But a beginner is not so sure of himself and thinks only of a soft landing. And so I looked over that big yard with the high sand hill. Just the place to ride a bronc, but I was a green-horn and not a real bronc rider. My eyes roam to the barn, chicken house, and the cellar. The ground has been scooped out and one can scarcely tell one from the other. The barn and coop are set way back into the sandhill. And the front part is the only part that shows. The roof is covered with many feet of straw to keep out the bitter cold of winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The yard and buildings are somewhat below average in neatness. But the orchard and berry bushes are well arranged. It brings out so much beauty that one forgets the clutter. One wouldn't dare ride a bronc here on the flat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vegetable cellar has a wide runway; wide enough for two men to carry a sack of potatoes down the steps without bumping the sides. At least it used to be a vegetable cellar, but Ed had made it into a bunkhouse. And inside there are two cots that are arranged in the gable ends. The rest of the cellar is covered with dirt. We even have a stove. But it has been warm down here even in the forty-below weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                I notice the steps are so wide down the cellar that one could lead a horse down them. So I made a choice; either be the best bronc rider of Idaho, or just plain old me. so I chose the latter. Ed has that bronc standing still a moment. He is waving his hand for me to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right down at the bottom of those steps, astraddle that bronc, a trick will be played. Ed promised so faithfully that he would keep that horse well snubbed so the horse won't buck. But I know, and it seems that Ed knows, too, that a bronc rider was never meant to succeed without some trick. It would be too stale! But not Ed — he has passed forty years.
            </p>
            <p>
                That makes sense. But I am wondering why he is so interested in that snubbing rope and I ask what is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                He said, “I want to be sure everything is holding. It seems to me the rope has slipped.”
            </p>
            <p>
                My horse is doing everything except bucking. He is side-stepping. My knees begin to feel the back-and-forth movements. My leg is the bumper between my horse Ed's saddle. Ed is fooling with that rope. Oh, no, he has managed to release my horse. I am moving right along. Ed has either thumbed my horse or else given him a good jolt with his spurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those days we knew nothing of spaceships. This is only a one-rated horsepower. But it has plenty to put me up, up, over, and around. The big sagebrush looks like a small moment in size. Even the wind that had been quiet until now — Ah, off goes my hat!
            </p>
            <p>
                So long as that horn stays put and my horse forgets any of that fancy side-to-side bucking I may stay on. I never before realized I was so heavy, as I am only a hundred sixty or seventy pounds. But it took a two hundred pound pull on that saddle horn to even stay on. Ed insisted there was plenty of room between me and the saddle seat. But I hit it so hard I went bang with a thud.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ed came riding by like a wild Indian, whooping and shouting, “Ride 'er, cowboy, ride.”
            </p>
            <p>
                My horse started turning circles. Then it headed down the flat, moving fast for fences, loose barbed wire, and the dreaded brush piles. My hands fell free from the horn and I reached for the bridle reigns.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a steady pull, I raised his head to where it should be. With the bit hurting him, he came to a stop. I kept pulling and the horse began backing. We weren't far from the cellar. And he gained speed going backwards about as fast as when going forward. Soon I felt the thud, thud, thud, as we went down those steps and came to a stop. I was off the horse in a moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>I had won!</em> — but not as a bronc rider, just on the awkwardness of that horse. Don't think that is all. I was plenty mad at Ed. I could have chewed his saddle!
            </p>
            <p>
                As he rode toward me he was bursting with laughter. Between that truly honest grin and a laugh he managed to ask,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where is that horse?”
            </p>
            <p>
                He knew where the horse was, but I just said, “You find him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I headed for the barn determined to get away from it all. He called to me, “Hey, come back here. We've got to get that horse out of there.”
            </p>
            <p>
                But I answered, “Get him out yourself. It's your saddle and bridle. And I don't care what becomes of the horse. You wait, I'll get even with you if it takes me twenty years to do it. I'll pull something on you!”
            </p>
            <p>
                It took Ed a long time to get the horse up the steps. And as he neared the barn, the horse's front feet straightened out and he wouldn't budge. I had to give him a scare. I picked up a handful of sand and threw it. And the horse lunged into the barn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ed unsaddled the horse. I took the blanket outside and looked it over for a sign of mischief but there was none.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked Ed if he had slipped a cocklebur or some sharp object under the blanket. He said nothing; just chuckled. About twenty minutes later I began to feel amused at the whole thing, and I brightened up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ed was laughing and he said, “The only way I knew who you were was the sight of those big feet dangling from the ground to almost over your head. But where was the horse!”
            </p>
            <p>
                My anger had disappeared and I walked up to Ed and said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “I am wrong and am through pouting. I can't be angry at you, ever. You only did what other men would have done. And right now I am getting a kick out of the whole thing, too.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We stood there and laughed our heads off. At the end of the day, we became again the same old pals. Ed was so perked up he told me such funny things I knew they weren't true. But it was all very exciting. And I thought to myself, here I am, twenty-one years old. And who is going to lead a horse around while I ride? No one would ever do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                My bronc-busting days ended in a minute or less, whereas it had taken weeks and even months building up to that point. That didn't mean I was afraid of horses! There wasn't a horse living no matter how wild I couldn't break. I have broken about fifty horses. Several summers ago I received five dollars a head for that kind of work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a short time I will be moving on. A man stopped in today and asked if I would work for him and I said I would. So next week he will come for me and that will be the end of my long stopover with the Parrish family, and a new beginning for me. There may be other times during the winter when there will be a few weeks work on the ice pond. We are the best of friends; nothing could change that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even good things come to an end — the happy interesting days spent with Ed and the Parrish family. They were wonderful years; the farm of forty acres that was producing. And the many sand hills. And Ed and I hauling loads of stuff to Pocatello to sell to stores and homes throughout the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember the thirty-mile trip with two wagons loaded with cases of eggs, bunches of radishes, and a variety of vegetables and butter. We bought the butter in Blackfoot. It wasn't the sweetest smelling article of foodstuff on our load. We had complaints about that butter; sometimes it was so old it had salt showing on the outside. It came direct from the farmers, as well as did the eggs. They should have had a sign attached to them saying, <em>DANGER, TAKE WARNING, DYNAMITE!</em> The stores were overstocked with butter and eggs at times and would sell below cost. It had been a mistake for us buying so many cases of both butter and eggs.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was about ten miles of sand between Blackfoot and Pocatello which took us a long day to drive. It was almost impossible for a car to travel through it. But in those days there were so few cars on the road. We enjoyed those trips which in a way, were a lark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ed had rented a house in Pocatello. This gave us a place to sleep and was also a store room for the vegetables. We would eat in a cafe in the evening and then take in a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember the lava rock schoolhouse that we built amidst sagebrush almost as tall as a man. It was of one room that was never locked, winter nor summer. The windows were never boarded. It was meant for more than just a schoolhouse but as a shelter for cowboys in bad weather. Anyone who needed overnight lodging could stay. There were many walking or riding along the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                Man's determination to forge ahead has changed all that. Dusty trails and sagebrush are things of the past. Now they are beautiful green meadows or golden grain in place of it. And from the sound of horses and squeak of saddle, there now is the hum of tractors and large machines. Aberdeen is now a thriving and productive farming community.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can go back to 1906-8 only in memory. How I would love to go up to Ed. And with a pat on his back say to him, “Do you remember the time you made a ditch on mother's timber claim.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother had bought fifty inches of water stock Northeast of Blackfoot. And Ed 'proved up' the water ditched to each forty acres in a canal to at least two miles. It took him at least a week, and with very little help. Harold and I were just kids and not much help. He did it with a plow, scraper, and team.
            </p>
            <p>
                How we loved those long evenings when Mother and Ed talked over days that had passed. They knew all the people along the way. We knew them too, Ed Bowman, who could ride a bucking horse as well backwards looking over its tail as a bronc buster could, facing its head. How avidly Harold and I listened to the stories. There was the old prospector and his big dog who was loved by everyone. One night the dog saved the old man's life when he was drunk on too much firewater, as the Indians called it. On the way home he fell into the Snake River and injured his leg. The dog braved the swift icy river and pulled him out.
            </p>
            <p>
                And we heard the story of the man who wore a wooden leg. He had hewn it out of wood and fitted it to his liking. How we loved hearing these stories from Ed, so friendly a man and so good to mother and everyone. He refused any wages for anything he did. Oh, Ed, when I think of you, I know you will have acres of solid gold to do your riding in your home in heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember when we were watching the bronc riding on the Indian Reservation. Ed was called to ride and that was worth seeing. And the pole fence lined with Indians in their bright-colored shirts with tails out was a picture of brightness. The breeze was strong and it flipped-flapped those long colored shirt tails.
            </p>
            <p>
                And the Indian boss, Joe Thorp, called out, “Ed, how about the next ride.” And Ed, with a smile, would slide off the pole fence and make for the chute. Soon Ed would hit the dust. Then he went into the second ride and that made him a winner! Those horse shows were exciting and they gave us years of laughs afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ed insisted the hardest ride he ever had was when he rode the hay rake with a runaway bronc team. Late autumn, and time to burn those tumbleweeds, and Ed got too close to the fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                A spark, perhaps, set fire to the heavy loaded rake. In a moment the whole thing was blazing. This scared the horses and they left the field running toward the sagebrush. The rake teeth clamped down on a large sagebrush. Everything stopped, but Ed! He was thrown ten or fifteen feet clear of the rake and horses. He landed on top of another bush but without a scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The horses didn't fare so well; the sudden stop broke the doubletrees. But the neckyoke held. This threw one horse down and turned both horses facing the rake.
            </p>
            <p>
                There wasn't anything amusing about Ed's space flight, at least, at first. But as the hours, days, and even weeks went by, it became more laughable. Other things were added onto the story. The additional things didn't happen, but the story became better with the telling. It was more for the joke than anything else. Laughs and kidding were part of the work of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking about Ed, who was part of my life for so long, has left this life. And the words come into my mind,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ride er, cowboy, ride er.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that even in the next life “Ed is back in the saddle.”
