                It took us two days to get home. On our first night's stop, the boys bought their supply of firecrackers, as tomorrow would be the 4th of July. And so we 'shot our way home' but without any loss of fingers, legs, or eyes. And we stopped on the way to visit an old friend by the name of Paul Cook. As we were eating supper one of those big firecrackers the boys had lit under the table, went off with a bang. Paul and I stood up fast. The boys didn't move. Paul's sister, Elsie, rushed in from the kitchen, thinking Paul had shot himself, or maybe the gas lantern exploded.

                And after that 1500-mile trip, I developed a lot of imagination and thought the old Buick had blown up. Then we settled down for the evening without any more excitement.

                And as we drove into our gate later on, we were home again, none the worse but with a better understanding of people, including ourselves. Would we have fared better if we had had all the money we needed for that trip, riding the train, using the sleeper, pushing a button for what we needed of the porter, with no responsibilities? Well, at least in my mind we would have fared better. The trouble with money, one never gets enough of it.

                Money doesn't always bring happiness, nor does it always hinder. Look at the huge donations handed down by the wealthy to institutions, children's homes, and so many places of need. Without those gifts, there would be much more suffering. Many homes or havens would have to close down. Money isn't always the root of evil. Much of it is a business deal and makes good advertising. Otherwise, that same amount of money would be turned over to the government.

                Being broke is a horrible thing, and most confusing. Yet I don't regret a single day of those predicaments and embarrassments. But as I look back, would wealth have made me a better man, more contented? I think not. We were born, and gradually attained a certain amount of good; bad, too, in habit as we grew. We all have many faults: some worse, some better than others. And maybe I am wealthy and don't know it. But anyway, <em>life is just a bowl of sweet cherries if we make it that way!</em>
