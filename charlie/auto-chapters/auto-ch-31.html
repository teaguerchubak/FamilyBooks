                When we left home we thought we would be back in ten days, but instead, it took almost two months to the day. Doesn't it sound thrilling and interesting thinking about spending two whole months vacationing? How wonderful just to be able to enjoy those many miles of carefree times in that mile-high city of Denver. And the climb of those many steps of that well-known capital building of Colorado. The dome part is made of copper. All this is interesting, but why two months instead of ten days? It was early spring in the month of May; time to be doing the farm work on the forty acres I owned at Bonita, Montana.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had checked over the tractor. It was in good shape. There were other implements that needed repairing. The biggest thrill doesn't always come from the farm work itself, but the planning and even daydreaming make it interesting and profitable. There was the vegetable garden to prepare. All things must be worked out to the best of one's ability. And that was just what I had been doing — until I was requested by the V.A. to go to Denver. After this notice, my plans were changed. A ten-day trip would not interfere with my farm work. But instead, I leased the forty acres for that year on a crop basis.

                Finally, I was through at the hospital and we could be leaving in the morning, but not when I owed the store bill and the rent of the cabin. And I had no money to even buy gas for the trip home. I decided the best chance of solving my problems was to try the Red Cross. I walked down to their office and told the clerk the whole story — what I owed, and to whom. And I must have enough cash, also, to take us back to Hardin. She told us to come back the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We walked down there earlier that morning expecting no loan, or at best, enough to pay my bills there. But she said I could get the money, but only the amount for which I had asked which would be spent on our trip back home; the groceries, and rent would be paid by them. Before she gave me the fifteen or twenty dollars she asked the name of the tourist camp and the owner's name so she could find out how much I owed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she phoned, the tourist owner said for her to give the whole check to Mr. Johnson and he would pay. The Red Cross lady was amazed as she said that was unusual because things like that just didn't happen. Then she said she would make the whole check out to me and for me to pay the bills, store, and rent. This we did, and were free of that debt and then could start for home early the next morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I stop telling this account of our trip to Denver, I want to say how kind this motel owner was. I became very well acquainted with her. And after we had been there two or three days she asked me if I cared to read the paper. So from then on, she brought the paper over every day. The trip was rugged and at times discouraging and disappointing. But these things though unexpected, gave me a better understanding of myself, as well as of others.

                This is worth a good thought as one travels over the highways of life. But at that time we were headed back over those big mountains and even Pike's Peak, and the city fast disappeared. We headed West with thoughts of a carefree trip back into Montana. The weather was bright and sunny and there were no snow or car troubles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second day, late in the evening, we were back at the ranch at Hardin and there, just as we promised — to care for their things while the Redmans took their vacation for two weeks. Keith painted the inside of their house. I already knew what my jobs were from past experience. After their return, it was only a few more days and we left there.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was about the first of July and I hadn't received either of my V.A. checks. I had been getting by on borrowed money and the little I earned. I notified the V.A. to send my checks to Hardin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, just the day before we left, my checks came. In thoughts I became rich overnight. A man who worked for the Red Cross for years told me to forget about returning my borrowed money to the Denver office. He said the Red Cross didn't expect it. But I mailed back to them every cent they lent me, with a thank you note enclosed. Now we were square with them and our conscience and could return home.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I want to remember and have the boys remember the things we did on those long evenings. Several times we went for a swim in the muddy Missouri River. It wasn't too deep nor too swift, but the boys needed watching. I just sat on the bank. And sometimes I wondered whether the boys were cleaner or dirtier than before their swim. And they had fun, anyway, and would always ask, “When do we go again?”
            </p>
            <p>
                And on the 2nd of July, on that nice big lawn under the shade of the trees, we ate ice cream and cookies — oh, plenty of them with the ice cream. In those days it was sold in gallon wood containers all packed with ice. It would keep frozen for a long time. I bought four gallons of it; some to eat and then some to take back to the ranch.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when we got to the Redman door, Mr. Redman answered the knock and he didn't take it the right way; not the way we intended. I told him we were leaving in the morning and that I thought it would be nice having a little party of remembrance for his family and for us. His wife was a very fine woman and a leader in her church. The oldest son was an apprentice, away from home, learning the carpenter's trade. He was living with a preacher. And he was a very fine young man, just out of high school. He said he was working on a house up the street, and as we would be passing the next day, to honk the horn and he would run down and speak to us. And sure enough, we met him that morning and he said, “I know Mother is going to miss you folks,” meaning especially on wash day. She had even said she didn't know how she would do everything after we left. Keith was a great help. And I had kept the garden growing, and free from weeds. Mrs. Redman felt real bad when we left.
