                Soon after that I went to Bountiful, Utah, and stayed with the Parrish family for about a year. My sister, Maude, had married Henry Parrish. I worked for a man who raised vegetables. During the winter I only worked a day or two each week. I had to board myself, but that didn't cost me anything as Maude took care of that.
            </p>
            <p>
                About this time I was getting old enough to handle horses. I became expert in driving a derrick team whenever there was hay to be put up. There were many jobs around the farm and I began to get big money of one dollar a day now. And I had my dinner plus the money. These wages helped a lot in our living expenses. I stayed home nights so managed to save a little. I had even saved enough money to take a trip to Idaho.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I bought some clothes. I was going to Idaho to visit Mother. She had taken up more land; one hundred twenty acres about eight miles Northeast of Blackfoot. I bought me a ticket and I believe this was my first train ride all by myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                This trip worried me as I didn't know which way I was going. And I thought the trainmen didn't know, either. I was wondering if they were taking me past Blackfoot. But at last they let me off at the spot of that little city of Blackfoot. I could scarcely wait to see Mother and her home. I could have ridden the train to within three miles of mother's place. But I didn't trust those trains, so I had got off too soon. I decided to walk the rest of the way. But it was too late in the evening to start walking, so I got a room.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next morning it didn't take long to get to mother's place. I was a good walker. But my kid days now seem somewhat like a dream. Thinking back, I must have been a toughened kid and very old for my age. I had more and different experiences than do the boys of today. As I sit alone in my little home up here in Hope, Idaho, thinking of those early years, I have a much better understanding of them and of the conditions under which I lived.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that this world and this life can be worthwhile and beautiful. Some of our happiness is derived from helping others, like my good friend Ed Parrish did in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I look over these acres of timber so green and fresh and I think deeply how we have been provided with so much for our happiness if we have the eyes to see it.

                My schooling ended and I became my own boss when I was about ten years old. I did just about as I pleased. I went to No. Ogden to stay with Uncle James and Aunt Libby Montgomery. Aunt Libby was Grandma Stevenson’s sister.
            </p>
            <p>
                James Montgomery, my uncle, was by trade a wheel-wright and made wagons and wagon wheels. He was an expert at his trade and was also a good blacksmith. Not only that, but he was the bravest man I have ever known. I had my first job with him and he kept track of it and paid me for my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Uncle James was born in Scotland and later was one of the first pioneers who came West. He was real old and was blind. But he walked around, using a cane. He was a wonderful storyteller and was always willing to talk about his experiences. That pleased me. So after the day's work was over and supper out of the way with dishes washed, I would edge up to him; then the stories would begin. However, night was the worst time of the day to hear certain kind of stories as I was dreadfully afraid of the dark. The stories were so spooky. But I always went back for more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my summer work as chore boy night and morning. My jobs were varied, herding hogs and cows, repairing the fences, and doing odd jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                One time everyone in the neighborhood was looking for me. I had been filling salt boxes for the stock. And it looked so good that I went back into the granary, opened a sack, and started eating salt. It made me very sick. I managed to climb over the high oat bin and went to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was so sleepy I must have slept several hours. At one time I heard someone enter the building and heard the words as he left, “No, he's not here.” But I was so miserably ill that all I could think about was myself. I wondered, though, why they were looking for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought I could get through the whole thing without telling anyone, but I soon found out different. I had to leave the granary eventually, looking like a whipped pup and I told of my whereabouts and why. I wasn't even scolded. It soon was forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were dangers for me in this beautiful Ogden Valley and many times I was deadly afraid. It was noted as a rattlesnake haven, as well as for those big blow snakes. My first job was herding about fifty or more pigs. I was warned to be always on the watch for rattlesnakes. My uncle had told me that they were no danger so long as I kept close to the pigs. I soon found this out, and more. A pig is death on all snakes. They even looked for them. And when one was found, one or more pigs would take after it. And in seconds the snake would be killed by the sharp toes of the pigs, and eaten. I guess we should give the hog more credit than we like to give him.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a pig beds down for the night, whether under a shed or out in the open, summer or winter, he will provide some sort of protection over his nose-snout. It could be straw-decayed matter or even dirt, neatly pushed over the bridge of his nose. I don't know if the pigs are warmer this way or if it is a habit.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Uncle Charlie says at this point, “Take note, kiddies, don't expect to keep warm with your head covered up and your feet out, dangling.”)
            </p>
            <p>
                Toward the end of the summer work, I was repairing a fence. As I dug around an old rotten post, all that was left was the broken-off stump. I stooped over, and with both hands tugging on that old post, out shot a snake above my head as though he was attached to a spring. He was an old snake and looked large as the stump itself. It could have been four feet long. Even now I shudder to think of it. Had he come out on my side I would not be here writing about it. I never stopped for my tools but ran for the horse and took off real fast, and I never went back. My folks were kind and understanding and never kidded me about my scare. But rather, they would side with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for my wages, there was no cash given me, and my board and clothes were free, seems to me. Aunty Libby told me they would send my wages to Uncle Henry Stevenson. But if they had given me five or ten dollars I would have been satisfied. But upon arriving back in Cottonwood, it wasn't long before Uncle Henry told me that Aunt Libby had mailed my check to him. And to think of that check — one hundred dollars! At this time I was wealthy. And in my young mind, became king among kings. I really had something of which to be proud. I was happy; none of the kids around had that much money.
            </p>
            <p>
                So much of the time I had been on my own and I had had many experiences. Travel along with me; the road may be bumpy, and your bed nothing but the bare ground, with the sky overhead. But adjust yourself and we will climb aboard this freight train.
