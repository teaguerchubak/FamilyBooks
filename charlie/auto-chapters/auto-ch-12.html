                I have written enough about my childhood and time has gone on. I am now into my war story; in my memory, it is so close, yet so difficult to describe. I had a very small part to do in World War I. And even though my war experiences were short-lived, it seemed years. Only God knows the anguish we spent while on the front line. We did our part. There must have been purpose in the War, though difficult to explain, and so cruel.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far in my story, I erased from my mind thoughts of war. It was put in the background and sort of forgotten, I thought. But since I was home, I could forget all about it and settle back into the work I love. I thought that if I did not talk about war, no one else would, either. That's the way I wanted it. But was I ever fooled! That, I found out when I arrived home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had entered the field hospital late in October 1918 and that was the last of the war for me. I didn't arrive home, though, until April 26, 1919, so I had had six months to forget the whole thing. We soldiers never talked WAR. But here in the States, it was different. It seemed that everyone wanted to talk about war. They would bunch around me and insist that I tell them all about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And they thought I should know why Jack, Joe, or Bill, never saw actual war services; yet they had spent months in the army and had never left the States. Yes, there was Henry; such a brave chap. But the war ended when his ship was halfway across the ocean and he was returned home.
            </p>
            <p>
                “How come you were in the war,” I would be asked. “You must have had pull.” — Yes, I did, but if so, it was the devil's strong arm that must have been on the end of the rope, I thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I really moved fast. In less than seventy-five days from the time of my draft date, I was marching up to the front lines. This was time figured from the time I traveled from Blackfoot, Idaho, to Camp Lewis and then to Camp Kearney, California, close to San Diego. Next, there was Camp Merrit, New Jersey, and into New York. After fourteen days crossing the ocean, we landed in Liverpool, England. I was there for about a week or ten days before crossing the English Channel into France.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even now I don't like to think about war. But in this story, it comes back to me how people thought I would sit down for hours explaining everything, especially about the Lost Battalion. They knew I was in that battalion. It was well published here in the States. Maybe just one would ask a question and by the time I had answered, the whole family would be seated around me listening, and asking. This would go on until it was noticed that it was getting me down. So to avoid this, I decided the best thing for me was to keep away from inquisitive people.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was natural that the folks at home were interested, bless their souls. But they didn't understand the effect it might leave on the soldier, himself. One could not explain these things except by living the days over. And my mind will have to be centered on the scene much the same as a picture show. It's all within. Most of the boys who had gone through the war wanted to forget. But in this story, I will have to relive it in order to write my war story. But it has been forty-five years since I was discharged from the army, on the 25th of April, 1919.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is now the year 1964, and how about that picture machine! Yes, it seems to be working. How lucky; otherwise my story could not be written. Here at this little table in my home in Hope, Idaho, I am safe and comfortable. But that little recorder tucked away in my head unnoticed is bringing to life again my war days of 1918, and the returning home in 1919.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my memory I am moving along faster now than then. This time I am leaving behind my gun, pack, sack, and pounds of shells and hand grenades. There was Camp Lewis and my first entrance into the army and boot training. It seemed they had picked out the biggest, loudest, bully obtainable. Then they put three stripes on his uniform and called him a sergeant, or in other words, a brainwasher.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the bugler had tooted his early breakfast call this sergeant would bolt into the barracks, frothing at the mouth, looking for somebody still in bed. If he found one, he would tip bed, man, and all, over, and then he would turn loose with the words, “I'm telling you boys, there isn't one of you in this barracks that has sense enough to pound sand down a rat hole. Where all of you belong is back home hanging on to mother's skirts.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In spite of this, there were many interesting days spent; not as one would a vacation, but under war conditions. It had been only weeks since we were in Camp Lewis under that rag-chewing, nail-biting sergeant. And that had put me wondering — when a sergeant could get that tough, how about a captain? He might bite or kick a guy down. I was shaking so much at the thought, that Elvin Pressley or the Beatles would have gone down in shame. We were told that to salute an officer was a must; not to the man, himself, but to the uniform which he wore. Many officers did not feel that way, but only felt the power and superiority over the under-dogs, it seemed. And I was only a buck private. In fact, there wasn't one in my company who had been promoted. We moved about too fast. But with me, there was no chance of promotion. One must have at least a high school education to get higher than corporal. I never went through grade school. Sometimes there was an exception as one, through deeds of bravery or one's own ability would rate a promotion. And many worthwhile deeds never 'got home' to the company commander.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were times when I was asked to do certain things such as take the place of a non-commissioned officer. I did accept at times, but other times I did not; such as when I was asked by an officer to take ten men up the river. I just stood there dumb-like. I knew what I was doing. But where were those ten men? He was the first man I had seen since the night before until I began to look around. Then the next man I saw was a major. He was crouched down in that shell hole directing his men up the hillsides attacking a machine gun nest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole thing even at that time didn't make sense to me. And I wasn't getting that kind of pay to risk the life of myself and the others while the major was safe in that shell hole. I would have been right out in the open with no protection at all. However, as long as I was there, no soldier ventured up the river.
            </p>
            <p>
                We spent fourteen days on the ship going to Liverpool, England. And here I was in the war already. I remember the Pacific Ocean, so beautiful with miles of oceanfront — so much different from the gray or muddy-looking water of the Atlantic.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were loaded on that boat for our ship overseas and it was a very quiet evening on board. I think we were in a downhearted mood, and a bit homesick. There was a crowd at the dock to bid us good-bye. They too, looked sad. No doubt many had already felt the sting of war. Naturally, there were no bands playing, nor any shouting. But as we steamed out from the docks, as many of us who could stand on the deck of that ship were waving good-bye. And we had the thought in mind, too, — how many of us would return!
            </p>
            <p>
                About the second day at sea, almost all became deathly sick. The top deck became the busiest part on that ship. As each felt the urge to 'feed the fishes' he would run for the side of the ship, anchor himself firmly to the top rail, and then heave and heave. What a sickness on our trip across!
            </p>
            <p>
                I think we all saw different things than we had ever seen before, like flying fish and floating icebergs. And we would run into schools of flying fish whenever the water was calm. But whenever the waves became rough and rolling, the farther those fish could fly! As the waves rolled, out would come the fish sailing through the air fifty feet at least, or maybe a hundred.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we turn our thoughts to how deep is the ocean, we glance over the deck. The ship climbs those mountainous waves and then settles back into a valley of peace, but not for long. Another big wave — yes, others are in sight racing toward us like an angry storm. It comes and goes, with not a breeze blowing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The water becomes calm as we near the harbor of England. Our ships are guided one by one toward the barge and the gangplank is lowered. Where are we? — in England, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being used to the rocking, rolling sea and walking about on the ship gives one a walk all by itself, that cannot be substituted on land. We were either stepping too high or else the ground came up to meet us too soon. Now we weren't interested in the words about how deep is the ocean, but how high is the sky. We were stepping it high and dry now, but only long enough to adjust ourselves to the solid earth below, away from the rocking sea.
