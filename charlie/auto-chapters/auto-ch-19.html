                I must have slept two hours when suddenly I awakened. I don't know from what; maybe a burst from gunfire. It had to be something, or I would have slept all day and maybe into the night. I awoke so startled I reached for my gun. I had the hand grenades in readiness just in case I was rushed. I sat there for a while and nothing happened so I stood up, slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked around. But there wasn't a soul in sight. My thoughts were to get out of there so I started walking. I knew I was under observation. But I was only taking those chances that I had taken before. It seemed the only thing to do and I walked on and on. Instead of taking the trail that seemed to be leading away from the front, I took the path toward the German side.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't long before I came to a clearing. Along the side hill, there was a trench. There were signs of life but I was too far away to distinguish Germans from Americans. I kept on walking as I was too far advanced to turn and run back. That would have meant certain death. Ah, much to my relief it turned out to be an American-held trench.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took very little strength of my own to hit the bottom of it because I was half pulled, half pushed to safety by those excited boys who whispered, “Where did you come from?” But I didn't know. I had to go somewhere and this seemed the most logical place to be. No one was in the mood for talking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The man next to me was a sergeant. And in a quiet voice, he asked if I was a 'runner' and I answered, “No.” A runner is one who delivers messages back and forth from the front. I knew it would be useless for me to try to fulfill that important job.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this time I was sick with the flu and barely holding my own. My feet were bursting from trench feet. Some days later I had taken off my shoes and tried walking in my stocking feet. This became a problem. My feet had swollen so large that I could not get my shoes back on.
            </p>
            <p>
                At last, day had come! We were being moved back. And what a sad-looking group of men we were after weeks of starvation, illness, and the wounded uncared for. I wasn't the only one who suffered, but all were affected in one way or another. Life or death seemed like a toss-up.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were very few planes used in those days to drop food to us. They had tried but failed. The planes flew high and the Germans seemed to get every release of food. This was heartbreaking for us.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were in what was called The Lost Battalion. Or perhaps it should have been the surrounded battalion, this Company of the 77th Division. We were really hemmed in. I found out later that my mother had followed this company on a map through reading the newspapers daily. I doubt that many of us knew we were surrounded. To have known the awful truth of our misfortune would have lowered to zero the morale of the men. But we knew we were getting gunfire from all sides. There was very little moving about. Those who got out of the trench looking for water were shot down. The only safe way to quench our thirst was to sip rainwater off the leaves of the brush above. And this wasn't always possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                That wonderful day of help came almost too late. And it was too late for many. As we moved back slowly, those who could — walked. And I walked, carrying my shoes in one hand and the gun in the other. Some were limping and some had no gun. My feet hurt so badly that I fell far behind the group. One after another passed me by.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sat down to put on my shoes but I could not do it. My feet were so swollen that I couldn't get my shoes on my feet. And I could not walk without them, either. So I pulled out my bayonet and started cutting my shoes. But it was too dull; more so, even than my case knife. I worked fast. I knew I must get going. I don't know how I ever got those shoes on. I scarcely had the strength to get them on my feet after I had altered them. But I was on time to catch the end of the line and fall in with the boys. There were none of us strong enough to walk faster than a snail's pace. But it was very important not to get behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I caught up they had heard the gunfire and were preparing to advance forward. About fifty men were being called.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was then released from guard duty. The captain asked me if I knew from which direction the gunfire was coming. And I say, “Yes, it is coming from concealed trenches, or from that clump of thickets to the right of us.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He said, “You go with the sergeant and show the way.”
            </p>
            <p>
                These words didn't please me very well as I had just got out of one hot spot just to enter into another. As we left, our officer's voice rang out with the words, “I don't want to see any of you boys until these guns are silenced.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We were all protected by trees and brush. It was late in the afternoon before we started. We stopped for the night before going any farther.
            </p>
            <p>
                By this time we had made contact with a runner who made trips back and forth from the company. This was important just in case we needed reinforcements. We had opened fire several times during the night and were answered by the German guns. There was so much brush and trees between us and the Germans, that no shot was getting through. However, as the sergeant said, “We will do plenty of shooting to warn the Germans we are coming.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It was daybreak now so the sergeant gave the orders to advance. In just minutes we were moving ahead. As there were no beds to make, no washing, no hair combing, no dressing, no coffee to drink, but only arising from the campground. Or maybe we just edged away from the tree, a spot which had taken hours to warm up. But as some of the boys said, “If we ever get home, the hardest thing to face will be to live again like human beings.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We were edging our way closer now. By this time the Germans were taking the lead with gunfire. This put us to challenge them. On each report of fire, we would stop and empty our guns, refill them, and then move up closer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This went on and on but the bullets were hitting only a foot ahead of us, and up to a hundred yards ahead of us. But we were all making plenty of noise, even the Germans. Can it be we were all thinking the same thoughts? The sergeant said, “The way it looks to me, it's going to be a hand-to-hand fight. You boys had the training in this type of warfare so I am not explaining. But remember this — there will be no use for hand grenades. Forget that you have any, and be prepared for anything. We are at the edge of trouble. Now is there any of you boys who would like to speak up?”
            </p>
            <p>
                It surprised me hearing so many speak the same thoughts I had in my mind. Our morale had become the lowest throughout the war days. Would we be strong enough to face the enemy and have the courage to stand up to the brutality of facing our fellow men, bayonet drawn, to pierce his body? Or would we have the strength to batter a man down by the stock of our guns? Could or would we stand up to this same treatment from the enemy? No one knew, yet there wasn't a man who asked to be excused. In war, nothing was considered other than to push forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                The German fire had stopped, even though it was only a few hundred feet to that German trench. We opened fire again. But there was no answering fire from the Germans. We moved forward cautiously, expecting to face the Germans at any moment. We had everything in readiness as we hit the trench. Then we gazed in astonishment. There wasn't a German in sight. They had retreated from this part of the woods. Our dreads and our fears vanished. We had pushed forward without a casualty. But in war, this is the way of things that happened. A victory won, or another attempted — never an idle minute day or night is the rule of it.
