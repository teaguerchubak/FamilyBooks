                As we stepped off board it was “Goodbye England — Hello France.” Again we marched in the dark of night into a little village upon daylight we saw it nestled between two high mountains. What a lovely spot! It was almost too pleasant to be true.

                The houses were neat and well-built and painted. They reminded me so much of our homes back in the States, but with one exception; the army didn't believe in late sleeping. And so as always, being awake most of that night had no bearing on the subject. Just as we got settled to sleep, that early call came for <em>EVERYBODY UP!</em> We must stand up for roll call regardless of lack of sleep and most of the time it was five or six A.M. This was painful. But there is always something to counteract the pain if one is bright enough to find that something!

                I suppose when the army came into being, that famous word, goldbricking, became the hero of one's army life. And it was very often practiced such as on our early breakfast calls. Most breakfasts in the army weren't worth getting up for anyway. So when one of the boys wanted to sleep in, he would turn to his buddy and say, “When my name is called, speak up for me.” That was much different from home where mother is the angel of the kitchen.

                At home, one could sleep until ten in the morning. And then, walking into the kitchen, saying, “Mom, I'm hungry.” As Mom turned, she would pat Sonny on the back and say, “Poor boy, Mom will have your breakfast ready in a minute.” (Isn't that wishful thinking.) There was no mama in this man's army for anyone. Many had to step down from the top of the ladder to the bare facts of life that he, himself, had been babied at home. These were the boys who took things the hardest. Then the change to the army and its many demands became too much for him. He became ill. This sort of illness was much more difficult to cure than the average type of boys who had to endure hardships while growing up.

                These things appeared in so many ways and became part of one's war experiences. In France, I was talking to a lad who knew he could not stand it. He could not endure the battles of war. He was away from home learning the hard way and it was too sudden and too much. He knew he couldn't take it, and I was wondering if I could. The difference could mean life or death. I never found out what happened to him. But I vouch that this lad never returned home; if he did it would be shell shock case which is worse than death. As for me, this doubting Thomas, I, had to see for myself, which I did. But I didn't know how long — another week, perhaps.

                In our home barracks in this neat little village in France, we almost forgot we were in the army. And last night as I think of it, we had a little party in a vacant house. A couple of French girls and a boy from California, and I am sure was Eddie Cantor, the actor, and I, had a party! They came from another barrack and we chummed around quite a bit. He told me that his mouth was his fortune. And was it big! Every time he laughed, and that was most of the time, that mouth would open from ear to ear. He could sing well and was an expert piano player.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was this vacant house across the road. And being boys at heart we had to investigate it. The window blinds were not pulled down, so we could see the full view of the room. It was neat. And the first thing which caught our eyes was the piano. We just HAD to enter. Eddie could play the piano. So using pocket knives, rocks, and sticks, we raised the window high enough so we could climb in.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were in that house about an hour. Eddie had taken over the piano and could he play! It was wonderful! He was a fine singer, too. We couldn't understand the French girls' songs but we had a happy hour. It was a decent pleasant musical gathering and one I will always remember.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of us left that room to gaze about the rest of the house. And we put everything in that room in order before leaving. We went back out the window and closed it tight. It was agreed we would return. And the soldiers went to their barracks and the girls went home. But things didn't work out as we had dreamed. Everything had been too pleasant to last.

                We were getting ready for bed when that meddlesome captain came in. He was meek as a lamb. But he was all shook up just the same. With perspiration running down his forehead, he said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Boys, we're moving up to the front. Get your things all packed fast and be ready to move.”
            </p>
            <p>
                What a headache! — not only for the captain, but for all of us. The captain was in trouble, but for what?
            </p>
            <p>
                We got our packs filled and ready in about fifteen minutes. We sat down in groups on our bunks waiting for orders. Each of us had our idea. The captain wasn't at his best. That captain had goofed! Instead of our being here, we were supposed to unload from the boat to freight cars for our trip to the front.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had been living the 'life of Riley' here, almost unknown and apart from this troubled world. But alas, this overburdened captain— this was the last we saw of him. Perhaps he 'got the works' from General Pershing, on down to buck private for his error. But this didn't stop us from moving on.
