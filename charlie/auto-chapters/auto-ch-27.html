                In two days we were on the road headed for Denver. But instead of using the word “Denver,” we said “Pike's Peak or Bust.” Yes, we did see Pike's Peak from a distance but that was all. We arrived in Butte on that first day's trip. It was late in the evening and we planned to stop for the night at 'White Hall' just over the divide. The car was doing fine. And as we drove to within ten miles of Butte, about one mile up the winding steep hill, our car came to a dead stop. There wasn't room to stop on that side of the road. So by backing down, I got the car off the highway and on the other side.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the first time anything had gone wrong with the Buick so I wasn't an expert on diagnosing the cause of trouble. But I tried. And by changing this or that, it still would not start. I sent Keith about a mile to the nearest phone to call the wrecker. It seemed hours before he returned and for some reason, he didn't get help.
            </p>
            <p>
                There we were stranded on that hill in the coming darkness and car after car came by but no one stopped. It seemed as though we would be there all night. When along came a Ford at high speed; much too fast for that mountainous road. This man stopped — even tho' he went a half block down the grade; he backed up and yelled, “Having trouble?” — and he was out of the car before I had time to say “yes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Best of all he liked to repair cars and was a good mechanic — as well as a heavy drinker. He was so intoxicated he never should have been on the highway at all. But he said over and over that he would never leave us until the car was fixed and running.
            </p>
            <p>
                The “timer” needed repair and that meant a trip to Butte. It was getting late and all the shops would be closed. But he told us to come with him as he knew all the shops that were open. This meant a twenty-mile trip with a drunken driver. And it almost seemed like a life and death situation. But that car must be moved from the highway so I chose the trip to Butte. At the time, three or four-hour trip. I wished I hadn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was only twenty miles and he was driving a Model-A Ford. He was driving sixty miles an hour around curves, through traffic, and bad roads; we weren't stopped once. He had at least one fault — he just couldn't pass up a tavern!
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though it was May and cold in the mountains and I knew the boys would be cold, they were at least safer than I was. I expected the worst — dreaded the next turn in the road, or seeing some object ahead of us. I felt sure we would have a smash-up. So on our return trip, I was picking out the turns and slowing him down. He was good-natured and didn't complain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone had to be sober on this trip so when we got to Butte and he stopped at the first tavern, I ordered a cup of coffee and he ordered beer. He turned to me and said, “You stay here while I go and get that part we need. I'll be back in no time.” After a half-hour wait, I wondered if he had left with his car and wouldn't return. I checked on that, but his car was still there. So I walked up the street for a block, checking for his appearance in every bar I came to. As I neared my starting point, here he came!
            </p>
            <p>
                His first words, were, “I was delayed; but just in no time, I'll be back.” I offered to go with him but he said, “No, just you take it easy.” I had just gotten settled, though, when he came back, saying, “Let's go back now and get that car fixed.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He knew what was needed, so I didn't question him until we were nearing the car when I asked how much the part cost. He spoke up quickly and said <em>TEN DOLLARS!</em> I asked if he had to buy the whole part. This brought out a chuckle and he said, “Forget it!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He said so proudly, “You needed the parts out here and the other guy, he's in town.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I was horrified by his stealing the parts to be repaired on my car and had I known, it never would have happened. It took only a few moments until the car was humming better than it had in months. There never was any more trouble from the distributor from that time, on.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was almost midnight, so I thanked this man and asked how much I owed him. He wouldn't tell me, so, by insisting, I gave him a five-dollar bill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though it was so late, we drove over the divide and a few miles beyond the city of White Hall. We looked for a place to spread down our blankets for the remainder of the night. It was a beautiful night, but cold. We didn't want to stop close to the highway, so we drove into the first gateway entrance that we saw. It was a flat country covered with sagebrush and used only for pastures. There were no houses.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was to be our first night in the open. And as we spread out our bedding by the light from the heavens, and got adjusted to the rocks and bumps, we heard a rattling noise. It sounded like a rattlesnake so we jumped out of bed and headed for the car, each with some bedding. Whatever it was under us, or in the bed with us, we never did know as we moved so fast. We shook out the blankets and for the rest of the night huddled on the seats of the car. At the peep of day, we were on our way, sleepless, but thankful that we weren't bitten by a poisonous snake.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this very early hour, we were headed East, “Pike's Peak or bust” — just twenty-four hours from the time we left home — discouraged — no, even though we were delayed for hours. But the trip was just in the starting stage, considering the remaining miles of untraveled road.
