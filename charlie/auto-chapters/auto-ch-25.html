                It was the first part of November when I had been sent to the base hospital in Nantes, France. This was after our release from what was known as the remnants of the Lost Battalion. I remember what a happy day it was on that November 11, 1918. A new day was born as the word that the Armistice had been signed. Every soldier in that hospital played some part in that celebration. The kitchen was stripped bare of everything that was suitable to be used as something to beat upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were many men who were shot up so badly they had to be lifted back to bed from the floor where they had fallen in their excitement. But outside the hospital, and throughout the town, everyone was celebrating; church bells were ringing and bands were playing. It was a wonderful time!
            </p>
            <p>
                We all know or have heard the war song, “There's a Long Long Trail A-winding,” etc., and yes, I found that out. We took a shortcut to the front, but getting out, it took a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A year ago with the 40th Division, we made our way toward a foreign land to conquer or to die — to free this maddening world from greed and destruction. Yes, less than a year ago we marched from our destination to the wharf, singing this song by request, “Goodbye, Broadway, Hello France. We're ten million strong. So goodbye Sweethearts, Wives, and Mothers. It won't take us long. Don't worry while we're gone. It's you we're fighting for. So Goodbye, Broadway, Hello France. We're here to pay our debt to you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It all added up to a rather large debt. As we look at statistics, we find that the army alone lost through death, 364,800 casualties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, it was grand being back in the States again even though things seemed somewhat different from those months here, there, everywhere. It took months for me to adjust even though my heart is here.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was wonderful being back on U.S. soil again. And we stopped in New York for a few days before going on to Cheyenne, Wyoming for our discharge. Being a casualty, the government was way behind in our monthly paychecks. If I remember correctly, we only received one full paycheck while overseas. This was handed to us in French money. Those Frenchmen were shrewd and the soldiers lost heavy on change. We did receive what was called Casual Pay at different times. It consisted of a small part of our paychecks. So it turned out that when we landed in New York so many of us were broke. We were unable to take in the interesting sights of this large city.
            </p>
            <p>
                But a bright thought came to me. “Why not send a telegram to one of my friends back home for a loan of $25.00?” I thought of the home folks I knew who would send me the amount asked for. In my mind, I ran over the list and picked out an old friend, Bill Johnson. He was the man who took me to the train when I left for Camp Lewis. And as he shook hands with me at the depot he wished me a happy return, saying, “If at any time you are in need of money, let me know.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, I had got acquainted with a soldier who was a foreman over a big cattle ranch in Dillon, Montana before he went to war. He, too, was broke. So I said to him, “Let's hunt up a telegraph office and I'll send home for $25.00.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We found there was an office right there on the campgrounds. I told the operator I would like to send a telegram to Blackfoot, Idaho. But I didn't have the money for the fee. He said that was OK. He would charge it at the other end. This was late in the evening. And by 10:00 AM I was informed the money had arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much to my surprise, instead of the twenty-five, he sent fifty dollars and insisted that I let him know the date and time of my arrival in Blackfoot. He said he would meet the train.
            </p>
            <p>
                With money in my pocket and new things to see, we started out that very day to see the bright sights of New York. We rode to the top of the Singer Building. I think at that time it was the tallest building in the world. We also took a sightseeing bus for an hour ride around the city. Our trip to New York with time and money to spend, was very enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, I enjoyed everything, knowing I wasn't a native of the East. Yet my war division, the 77th, was from New York. I thought that entitled me to become at least a button-hole relative of that state. As I walked and rode about the city I was proud of the thought and cherished it highly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world is a wonderful place, especially our good old U.S.A. And how glad we were to be back on its soil!
