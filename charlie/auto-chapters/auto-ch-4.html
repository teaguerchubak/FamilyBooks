                It was early autumn when I was about twelve years old and I had made some money during the summer, perhaps about eight dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
                The year was 1904 and I was headed for Idaho to visit my mother. An uncle, Eugene Stevenson lived in the vicinity of Idaho Falls and I had it in my mind to visit him on the way. I would go by freight train. In those days the brakemen charged one dollar a ride in a part of a division.
            </p>
            <p>
                My trip was only twenty-five miles but I was charged one dollar. I rode first class as far as the freight train riding afforded. The brakemen were polite, considerate, and very inquisitive as to where one was going and why. They were making sure by their questions, that the boy wasn't running away from home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had told Mother I was going to make this trip and she never did tell me I could not do things. Other mothers might say, “You're too young; why not wait until a certain time and I will give you passenger fare money. That would be better than freight. Maybe you might slip under the wheels,” etc. — Oh, no, not my mother. She didn't tell me NO. But I was no different from other boys. All I needed was a leeway and then I would take the whole rope; this, I did. Most of my experiences were learned the hard way. But as it said in the newspaper one day, BEING A PARENT IS SO SIMPLE EVEN A CHILD CAN OPERATE ONE. My life was one of trial and error. Maybe I turned out rather well, patting myself on the back, considering that I was on my own much of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The freight train was hours late this time. Instead of arriving in the morning, it was noon. This made me too late to start for my uncle's home as we didn't arrive in Idaho Falls until way in the afternoon. I decided to find a room for the night. Everything in those days was cheap so a bed cost me 25 cents — a good meal, and haircut, also a quarter each.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had plenty of time that evening to inquire in town as to the address of my uncle Eugene. He owned a farm a few miles from the city. I found a clerk in a hardware store who knew my uncle and he gave me the information, saying my uncle had been in town just the other day. He lived about twelve miles East of there. If I started walking early in the morning the mailman would come along and pick me up and let me off right at his gate. With this information, I really was in good spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the long evening ahead of me I would go to a picture show as it only cost ten cents. But first I needed a haircut. It had been weeks since my last one and I didn't want my uncle to see me with these shaggy ends. But I never before had been in a barbershop. Oh, well, I had plenty of money; may as well live it up. I had enough for anybody, these few dollars! I could stay right in town for a whole week if I wanted, with a dollar left over for my box car ride back to my Idaho home if I wanted to. This was fun. But the business of a barber worried me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I walked up the street and back and forth several times. I looked in at that strange place trying to accustom myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I watched and noticed I would be escorted up to a barber chair. I was a bit scared of cops, though. Maybe I looked like a kid running loose about town all alone. I might land in jail. I might be doing, not shoplifting, but too much window shopping. All these things ran through my mind. Even though I was innocent, I might feel guilty if the cops nabbed me. Maybe I would even feel like they had done the right thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next time around, I got up the courage to go through the door into the barbershop. Oh, you barber — what a gentleman you are, I was thinking — so polite and understanding. You even met me at the door and led me to a chair. And with a gentle lift, seated me on that rocking horse chair with extra room for three more kids. Oh, what fun this was!
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my young years, I had become acquainted only with dull shears; a tingle, because the shears failed to open. But out would come my hair! Naturally, one ear would be just too large; maybe a little snip here and there would get them trained in the right shape. So I just sat there in that barber chair, my whole system tightening, expecting a snip or two on the ears. It wouldn't be natural if there wasn't a reasonable amount of hair pulled out by the roots. I kept waiting and waiting and nothing happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it gave me a very bright idea; no one except a barber was ever going to cut my hair again. This barber was jolly, kidding me all the time. It made me wonder how anyone could be so happy when working all the time. But at twenty-five cents apiece, — that was a lot of money, and he must earn plenty.
            </p>
            <p>
                At last, my hair was cut! I hadn't understood barber talk about different tonics, so my answer was always “yes” when he explained treatments for the hair. Anyway, why not get the works? The sign said HAIR CUT 25¢ — right in plain sight of everyone. First, the haircut, then a wash, a bit of hair tonic sprinkled on now and then would be very good for the hair and do a lot of good. So my answer was always “yes” to other things, too, along with steam towel which was so very helpful, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I stepped down from the chair and reached into my pocket and brought out twenty-five cents, feeling as perky as a newly spanked baby. I was having second thoughts; should I have even spent two bits for just a haircut? Maybe I'll be sorry, I was thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as I handed the barber the quarter he wouldn't take it. He said, “Let us do some figuring. The haircut is 25¢ — shampoo, 25¢ — perfume and hair tonic, 25¢ — then extra blowing drying, and electricity another quarter. But we'll just call it one dollar even,” he said, and so kindly said, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just think — a whole big round dollar just spent on my head! Was it worth it? No, not in that day. And I didn't dare tell any of the folks of my extravagance. Nevertheless, I took in a show that night, also had supper, and breakfast. And then I started out early next morning for the home of my uncle. All turned out as expected — the mailman came along, stopped, and yelled out, “Hey, boy, how about a ride.” I was willing, and he was as anxious for talk and joke as the barber so we got along fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything in those days was horse and buggy. And as we traveled along we stopped at each mailbox. Sometimes the mail patrons waited at their mailboxes and this delayed things. He was a fine talker and never was the first to leave. It was late afternoon before he let me off at my uncle's gate.
            </p>
            <p>
                My folks were surprised to see me but glad, and I was with them for several days. But their children were just youngsters and there was no one for me to play with. I got tired sitting around so about noon one day was ready to leave. I started out walking and walked until it became dark. I knew I couldn't get into town until too late, so I looked for a place to spend the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was autumn. The nights were clear and frosty. I was looking for a strawstack in which to spend the night. At last, I saw one out in a field quite a distance from the road. Nearing it, I noticed trails leading to what looked like a tunnel hole into the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving closer, sure enough there was a tunnel with trails joining at the entrance. It became more interesting by the minute. That would be the best resting place one could find out in the open. It was just right for a night sleep. Then a question came into my mind; what kind of animals were sleeping in a place like that?
            </p>
            <p>
                I hesitated while thinking there might be something in there that would eat me up! Or maybe I would be run over. So I stood by the opening and started yelling at the top of my voice, making all the noise I could. I heard a shuffling inside and then grunts; now I knew it was filled with hogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In seconds out flew a big black one; then another and still others; about ten in all. When one passed me by, he let out a few barks. When I say “flew” that is just what they did; there was no bunching up. They were going out of that tunnel so fast they were unable to turn to their well-used trails. They were “flying” out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, they got straightened out and back through the field; I hope to find another sleeping place, but I did not intend worrying about those hogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that excitement, I felt sure all the hogs had left, so I crawled to the end of that long tunnel. I found a well-arranged bedroom, well-padded and with plenty of space.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was quite cool this time of year. So no matter where one slept out in the open, if there were no covers, one would not be warm. But I was protected from the wind and I managed to rest a little. But I didn't sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even to this day when I think about it, I can see that straw stack and those big black hogs belting from their nice warm bed, and yes, I, on all fours crawling back and settling down for the night in a made-to-order bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early next morning upon arising, I started to walk. I had none of the comforts of home but I was on my own; my own boss. Soon I was back in Idaho Falls.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had my breakfast and then walked to the depot and settled down for a wait. I thought I still had a few hours wait while box cars were shifted onto side tracks. Idaho Falls at that time was the largest town this side of Pocatello. Opposite the depot across the tracks there were no yard cops to bother one. I just stood waiting. And it wasn't long until a freight train came. A freight train ride was one of my biggest thrills of the trip, outside of the hogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a different brakeman than I had seen before so I asked him if this was the train out of there. Then he had to know my whole history; why was I leaving, and to where. Then he asked, “You aren't running away from home, are you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I said I wasn't, and I would get off at Wapello. He said the train didn't stop there. He asked if I had a dollar, so I handed it to him. He walked down the tracks a short distance. Then he helped me up through the door with orders for me to “sit down on the floor; stay put and don't get up.” As he left, he said, “I'll find out if we can stop at Wapello and I'll let you know.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The train pulled out and he hadn't shown up. I was worried. But the stop before last where I was to get off he came and got into the boxcar with me. He said they wouldn't stop the train but would slow down enough for me to get off. He said he would help me. So, as we arrived, the train slowed almost to a man's walk and the brakeman jumped down. I sat on the door and he lifted me down. I was thrilled over my first boxcar ride. The four-mile walk home seemed only blocks to me. There were so many things to think of; the barber, mailman, the hogs who turned over their warm bed to me — whether they wanted to or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                No one accomplishes anything without first having the will to succeed. I am thinking of an article I read called, “Faith, Hope, and Charity.” Hope is in reach of all of us. Surely I had faith at that time that I would get to my uncle's home safely. So my mission was accomplished!
