                In the autumn of 1913, I became of age; twenty-one. I felt happy about this because my ambition was to become a locomotive fireman. The job required one to be at least that age. I had spent the past summer at the home of Ed Parrish in Blackfoot, Idaho. I had saved enough money for train fare to Salt Lake City. I had a few dollars on hand to last until I landed a railroad job.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a worn and tattered suitcase, but no clothes to put in it. I had some bedding which consisted of two nice blankets and one new wool quilt the Relief Society had sold me for five dollars. It was a real beauty; hand made and tied. Instead of leaving my old suitcase behind, I managed to get all my bedding into that case but it took men to do it. Ed Parrish stood on that suitcase while I snapped it together.
            </p>
            <p>
                I always had such a sad feeling when I had to say goodbye to Ed. He was one of those down-to-earth cowboys, so jolly. And he had such respect for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember the Parrish and Grover families so well. They were so good to mother and us kids. They always lent a helping whenever we needed it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And Henry Parrish was my brother-in-law, having married my sister, Maude. But my sweet little sister, Maude lived so short a time. She died after the birth of their second child, Mark, who was born 5 Sept. 1906. Little Aleen was still a baby, having been born 3 Feb. 1905. She died 10 Oct. 1906. Ed and Henry were brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I left for my job, Ed took me to the train. And I arrived in Salt Lake City early in the morning. The first thing I did was apply for the job and my name was put on the list with others. We wanted to be student firemen and as soon as our names were called it meant an exciting moment in our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was plenty of work at that time. They told me that if I took any kind of job on the railroad I would be called much sooner. So I chose the Bridge and Building, known as the B. & B. Dept. That very day I was handed my pass and my destination was Gunnison, Utah.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work train of four box cars and one flat car were sidetracked, and the four were for our living space. There was the boss and four men on the job. Three box cars were used for bedrooms and one for kitchen and dining room. The flat car was for tools. The one we used was hand-operated and got us to and from work. It took four men and much pumping to make any headway.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this cold and frosty morning town in Southern Utah, it took four hours to get things warmed up. By noon the weather was almost too hot for comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                One cold morning we left early on a repair job which had to be finished by early afternoon. The boss said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Boys, we eat when this job is finished and then you may take the rest of the day off.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We agreed on that. Two of us lifted the heavy car onto the tracks whereas on a normal work day the four of us could scarcely get it up. We were united in our strength and speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                At times we had got in each other's way, but by 11:30 we had everything finished. The sun was doing its best to shine and so were we. But some naughty kids almost spoiled our day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were going down the track about thirty miles or more per hour. Every one of us were bearing down on the handlebars, even the boss. Suddenly the car left the track but it didn't tip over. As for us, there wasn't one of us standing but we had a few hurts and scratches. And our pride was hurt. We found on one rail these kids had placed a notched two-by-four over it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solemn wish for that day, and days afterwards, was that if we ever laid hands on those boys our memory of their fun, and their memory of their punishment would not soon be forgotten. Their spanking would be so well-seated that they would be standing for weeks. The boss said even though we gave the kids the worst beating of their lives, we would have no fear of their parents. We had the railroad to back us up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our job wasn't all work in this beautiful fertile valley of Gunnison. There were acres and acres of orchards. And the green meadows with sparkling streams which were haven for trout, and the wildlife that roamed those hills — all these gave me a warm and wonderful feeling for those early day pioneers. It proves beyond doubt that the long years of hard work and even hardships were not in vain. We enjoyed all these beauties of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I look down memory lane I remember my boxing friends. The boss had worked to get a fight going with one of his boys on the job. And the other boy lived about twenty miles from Gunnison. One young fellow from there would come for us in his Model-T Ford to take us the twenty miles there and back. But we couldn't get the Ford started and we pushed it a mile; then we gave up and left it by the side of the road. Some farmer came along after we had walked seven or eight miles, and we dragged into town one half hour late and worn out.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the fight came off and my pal got knocked out. He made ready for another fight. But I was broke. And I was twenty miles from my nice warm bed. But I was young and could take it. I had had no dinner nor supper that day. And it was about 8:00 PM. I walked until I no longer could put one foot in front of the other. So I headed for a haystack which became my bed for the night. I spent a very restless night and at the peep of daylight I was on my way again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was tired and hungry. Regardless of my pride, I had to eat. The ranch houses were miles apart. But the first house I came to I asked the lady for a hand out. It was very difficult for me to do this but hunger had overpowered me and left me no choice. The dog didn't take too kindly to me and put up a noisy fuss. This brought the lady of the house to the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a flash, she was in front of me. I didn't even have a chance of collecting my thoughts to figure how to tell her I was hungry. I reached into my pocket and found a precious dollar and handed it to her, asking if she would be so kind as to fix me a lunch. She came back with several sandwiches, so neatly made, and handed me back seventy-five cents.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became a trifle bolder and asked if I could sit on the chair on the front porch. She even brought me a glass of cold water and a glass of milk. In my worn-out state, I had tears in my eyes over her kindness. (And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones of cold water only … he shall in no wise lose his reward.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I could walk back to base; I felt so refreshed. And I arrived early in the afternoon and spent the rest of the day lying around. But the following morning I was back on the job. My boxing friend didn't show up until a day later.
            </p>
            <p>
                The boys were a nice bunch. There were three of us about the same age and we had plenty of enthusiasm and vitality. But we never visited the town. The boss had given us strict orders to stay away from there. It was one of those things with our boss — do as I say, but not as I do. He meant it, too. He said he was old enough to take care of himself. But he didn't want [rest of the sentence is missing.]
