                Mother was close to forty before I was born. I never did find out her life story. I wish she had written it. Mine could never equal hers, nor could it be that interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope everyone writes his life story, as I am doing because Josephine asked me to write it. Our lives are too new right now to all of us. But in fifty or one hundred years from now, our stories could be very interesting. It would have been so wonderful if we had Mother's story. If living, she would be well over a hundred years old. What a story that would be! It makes me happy knowing that as I write down these things, our dear kiddies can look back to these days and share with me the happiness, hurts, and even innocent tears that we shared. They all meant so much.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take after my mother in many ways, with the exception of knowledge and schooling. As I travel down this rugged road of life I'll just have to be myself, whether in sorrow or happiness. And I have to have faith and courage and be thankful for what I am. I have had the opportunity of associating with some very fine people in my life; people of high standing. But no one could ever equal my mother.
