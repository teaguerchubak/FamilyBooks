                Our arrival in England became one of the grandest receptions ever afforded anyone, bar none, king or presidents. The streets were crowded by young and old. Many of the older folks were crying. It would have taken a pretty tough American soldier not to have shed a tear nor had a choked-up feeling one gets in sadness. We were in a foreign land and a bit homesick. This feeling became more touching seeing the thousands who lined the sidewalks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, we were pushed out into the streets. As we marched along, those saddened people became overjoyed. It was only happy tears shed that day as those overburdened English people celebrated with us in joy and a prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our own band led the parade starting with “The Stars and Stripes Forever.” Up the block, an English band stepped in and took the lead, and escorted us through many blocks of the city's busiest sections. Our marching was slowed down by the hundreds of people wanting to shake our hands. We were able to give a little handshake about every ten feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we reached the busy part of town, the streets were lined with shouting, smiling happy people. Flags of the allies fluttered in the breeze from every window high above the streets. Other bands joined in, from bagpipes to drums. It seemed almost everybody carried some kind of flag. Streamers were flying overhead across the streets. Printed in large letters were the words <em>GOD BLESS AMERICA, — YOU BOYS ARE THE SAVIORS OF OUR COUNTRY — MAY GOD BLESS AND BE WITH YOU!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our march through this great city of Liverpool was so impressive and beautiful. I will always remember it. My prayers go back to those energetic people who so bravely endured those hardships, waiting for the worst to come but being determined in spirit and prayer. Defeat held no meaning for them, so closely bound were they in life.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a purpose in every ship that crossed the ocean and every American soldier who trod those foreign lands; might meant right! The sin of greed put those German rulers down in shame, but only to rise again twenty-five years later. Again England was almost knocked out of the war by the greed of Hitler. Again the United States was called upon to do her part in the safety of our country. The draft became law. Uncle Sam sent out notices and I received mine. I was required to register. But by this time I had leased a farm. The Government was a bit lenient on farmers than in the first world war. I wasn't called up this time for services in the second war. But I did have to sign over my truck and tractor along with other things. In case of an emergency, these things might be a necessity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking about war again, my mind goes back to our arrival in England those many years ago. At the end of our march, we left the city for our barracks miles out in the country. This became our home until we crossed the Channel into France.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things now began to shape up. We were assigned certain duties. We had no choice when it came to guard duty. And I was put in as guard. Boys without passes were kept within the boundary of camp. This was my first assignment, but not my last. I was called upon so many times that I felt I was imposed upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                A guard must walk his post regardless of where we were. Right out in the open spaces was the most dangerous part of war. If a guard fell asleep on guard duty the death sentence could be imposed. If one failed to obey the order of the guard when he ordered <em>HALT — WHO GOES THERE —</em> without the proper identification and his reason to pass, the duty of the guard was to shoot. The guard's orders were to be obeyed. My duty was to keep back those eager boys who wanted to go out and 'take over the town.'
            </p>
            <p>
                Guard duty became more interesting than I expected. The officer of the day, a lieutenant, came by and called me by name, saying, “Sit down for a spell. I would like to talk with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, how nervous I was. What had I done? But after I sat down, he did the talking. He said,
            </p>
            <p>
                “You're doing OK. Don't worry if some of the boys sneak by. We will be here for a time so take it easy. I promise you there will be no trouble for you.” Then he asked,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you remember when we were on board the train headed for New York? On that dark night, our train was side-tracked at a station in Southern Utah. You were in the baggage car on kitchen duty. As you opened those sliding doors, there I stood on the platform. I was in the outfit of a citizen. As we talked, you asked me if I would mail a letter for you to a sister in Salt Lake City. I took that letter but it never was mailed. It didn't get any farther than the captain's office on that train. For this, I owe you an apology. I was sorry to not mail your letter but it was my duty.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We stood up and shook hands and he said, “Now I feel better because you understand.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, I did understand. And I understood that a man such as he, a 1st Lieut. could be a gentleman. He must have felt guilty at that time, a well-dressed civilian in a dark of night, but an officer. I had not known my letter had been handed to a Lieut. There were no complaints except for the fact that our destination was New York. Had I made that known that we would be passing through Salt Lake City the following day there might have been trouble. I had said I would love to meet some of the folks.
            </p>
            <p>
                But my sister, May, never received that letter. Instead, the captain received me, letter and all. I thought, 'Oh, you villain!' I was taken into the captain's office and I doubt that I saluted when I entered, or when I left. This alone could have added six or more weeks for me in the dog house. But I escaped this and spent two days only, in the coach for punishment. In less than five hours our troop train stopped in a small town and the boys were taken off for exercises, all, except for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The officer came through the car and asked, “Why are you sitting there?” He knew, but he said to me, “Come on out. We are marching through this little town.”
            </p>
            <p>
                After all, the only punishment I received, was to face the captain, and that was punishment! This little experience with my captain was my first and last experience like that; not that I hadn't disobeyed the rules of war after this, as I had. But my reasons were good.
            </p>
            <p>
                It came time to pack up and say good-bye to England. We were to cross the English Channel and set foot on French soil before daybreak. Sometime during that night we were awakened and told to be ready to move in one half hour. This meant we must pack everything. As each man finished, he would step out into the dark to line up. After roll call, it wasn't long until we moved on. We were loaded into small boats before daybreak and stood with our packs on. No one could possibly fall over. We were packed too tightly together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Channel was alive with those huge waves just as rough as the ocean ever was. But this small boat was like a ship on the ocean, compared with those big steamships. We plowed over those large waves, the boat almost straight up and down. It seemed we were headed for the bottom of that channel. What a feeling! I do believe there were times when the boat couldn't take the waves and would surely go underneath. We could hear the force of the water as it hit the sides and over the top. Whenever you hear tall tales about the English Channel, believe every word. The Channel isn't very wide, probably about thirty miles, but it took two hours for the trip.
