                The years had gone by and I had the wanderlust. One spring found me somewhere else than with Mr. Johnson's family. I met a man, new to me, who upon introduction, proved to be my uncle. Mother, in Nov. of 1903 had married for the third time. A Mr. Frederick Steiner who lived on a farm in Mackay, Idaho. It was close to Mother's first homestead. He was a well-to-do cattleman. Mr. Steiner and my uncle Nephi Porter Stevenson became partners in several claims. Mother cooked for them one summer. Mother had always loved living in Idaho and she had many friends up there.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I first met Nephi, with his long white beard, I was almost positive he was an uncle. He looked just like Grandpa Stevenson. Uncle Nephi was the first child born to Edward Stevenson and his first wife, Nancy Areta Porter. He was born 13 July 1846. To me, he looked to be about seventy, or more. He was very active in whatever he did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Years before, he had left home and became a well-educated mining engineer during his life. He had left his family and drifted back to Idaho and was interested in prospecting out of Mackay. There had been doubts in the minds of the Stevensons that Nephi was alive. He had been gone from home so long. But later he went to Salt Lake City and became re-acquainted with his family.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for Mr. Steiner, as time went on, it proved that there were other ranchers and cattlemen smarter than he, and he went broke. Mother and Mr. Steiner drifted apart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Uncle Nephi took to me right away, knowing I was a lad tough enough to take the hardships that prospectors had. I was young in age but big. And I thought it would be fun to rough it in those high mountains. We had spent a month waiting for the spring thaws to melt the snow up there. We had filed on a homestead a few miles from Mackay and had a two-room cabin built and this is where we waited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we got off on this adventure, arriving in Mackay late in the afternoon. We spent some time visiting and buying groceries until almost dark. Uncle Nephi said he had traveled over that trail many times and we would get there. But in the darkness we lost the trail and instead of being on the highland trail, we ended down on the river bottom. I am quite sure it was the Lost River.
            </p>
            <p>
                At that time of the year there was a big thaw and water was everywhere. Water was almost up to the cabin door, we found upon arriving in the middle of the night. It hadn't been much fun. We each had a gunnysack full of groceries and clothes. We were loaded down and our sacks became soaked. We just dragged them along. We had traveled through water and darkness with water over our shoes. And in places, water was to depths of our shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
                At last, we had walked out into a meadow. By this time the sky was brighter and Uncle Nephi got his bearings. Soon we were in the shack changing our clothes by a warm fire. We put on old duds. And then Uncle Nephi, being so old, was sick in bed for a few days. But I, being young, didn't mind any of the hardships after we arrived at the cabin. I enjoyed almost everything. But I got terribly lonesome sometimes. I would become quiet from those feelings, and then Uncle Nephi, knowing the Bible from cover to cover, would preach to me from the Bible. One time he sent for some church books and one was a church book Grandpa Stevenson had written years ago. And he sent for books on farming and chicken raising. He did many storms and bed and food. It was always late when we arrived at our log cabin and we were tired and worn out from the long hike. But I helped Uncle Nephi for three years and they were a very rewarding time in my life. But with all his kindness, I was always glad when our work at the end of the summer was done and we headed home. As I think back upon these things, it seemed that the days, months, and even years passed very quickly.
