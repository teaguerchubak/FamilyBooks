                In my story, I cannot bring forth the thoughts of others, but I have a fair understanding how the war affected all of us. There were times when we were free to think as we pleased, even though we were still and our souls seemed held together only by threads. But we were comforted in the privilege we had of being alive. We had joy and happiness at times, as well as the horror of war. We shared them together. Many went through a deeper hell than I ever knew about. At times I felt as though I was guided and protected. I stepped out of certain death many times. Many came out alive even through grueling discomforts and almost certain death.
            </p>
            <p>
                The boys who fought our battle never had much to say about war. They didn't want to talk about it and neither did I, unless one became too insistent. Each step on foreign soil made history. Our division was shoulder-to-shoulder with the French Army. Whenever we need help or information on the lay of the land, directions, etc., a Frenchman was called upon as moving up to the Front. And we were close enough to hear faintly the sounds of battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were stopped one day to relieve another army, perhaps, that was due a rest. The orders came from the captain to drum up a detail to go back to the field kitchen for food. I was asked to go along with three or four others. We didn't know much about directions so a Frenchman was called to lead the way. This field kitchen had been moved to about a mile from the Front. As this Frenchman moved on, we dropped in behind him in single file. We had walked about halfway when we came to a trench and whenever we came to one we would walk in it. Sometimes we had to walk in the open with no protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                All at once the Germans would open fire on us from their big guns maybe miles away. This was very unusual, using big artillery on so few men. This being our first time under gunfire and knowing their perfect marksmanship, we were well shaken up. For a while we lost track of the Frenchman, one of those who had seen war service since 1914.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of doing as our guide did, we slowed down, thinking we could doge those big shells. But after about a dozen shots hit around us, the firing was stopped. One of our boys was knocked down but wasn't hurt. The rest of us were none the worse except for the dirt and grime that fell on us from the shots.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fear of being mangled and torn apart to die later could not be brushed aside from our minds. It can be understood no doubt why I felt it was by some higher power that I survived. I was one of many who lived on and had to accept as part of my life, right and wrong, happiness and hardships all through my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heading back we tried to keep up with that Frenchman and had trouble doing it. We each carried a two or three-gallon can filled with soup, and our canteens filled with water. The Frenchman had such speed that we kept him in sight only about half the way. We were in the best of physical shape but were no match for him.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was dangerous poking along, though, or even stopping. I was bringing up in the rear. And we dropped down into a trench and I came across a lad who for some reason was lying down flat, too weak or sick to get up. My detail passed him up thinking he was dead. But as I neared this boy I heard a faint voice asking for water. I stopped; I wasn't supposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I reached for my canteen and he took it just as a hungry baby takes his bottle. While he was drinking, I reached down for his helmet. I scraped out the mud and dirt from it by running my hands in it. Then I poured a good helping of this mixture of vegetable soup into the helmet. I had disobeyed orders! We had been told our duty was not the caring for the sick and wounded. That was to be done by professionals. Our only duty was to push forward. Yet I never had seen a stretcher case or a wounded soldier being moved off the front lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I reached down to get my canteen, it was empty. This sick lad had drunk all of it. Water was one of our biggest problems throughout the woods. There were lots of springs but there were always signs forbidding us to drink from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I left this boy I had done these things in less time than it took to write it. I moved fast and was able to see the last of that detail go out of sight. Those cans were heavy. But my canteen was empty. With a somewhat saddened heart, I headed for the front lines without water. I was thinking how stupid one can be going with an empty canteen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then a wonderful thought took over then, even as now: <em>was this soldier boy's life spared through my act of understanding?</em> It very well could have been. If so, then my efforts of that little time spent, and my empty canteen had been paid off in millions; not in cash nor medals, but in a sense of compassion which is within all of us. And it took courage to walk alone that half mile. It was much more dangerous alone than with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know where the soldier boy came from. Maybe he had been lost in the woods for days too sick and weak to move. Many of the boys got the Asian Flu and toppled over. I did that, myself. The only thing I clearly remember of that time was the spot in that trench where I slumped down. It was a wide place, room enough so that the troops could pass by. A long column of men were marching past me as I lay there. And I heard one say, “There is another soldier that has been shot.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I must have looked dead all right, but am still here today to tell about it. I do not know whether this was my company or not, nor if they were going in, or coming out. I cannot place the day nor days that I was lying there but I remember how I got started again. I remember our detail returned to the starting point that day, all with soup except I. And we found that most of the company had moved forward. The men were told to put their soup to one side of the thicket and then march in single file about ten feet apart. That was the last of that hard-to-get soup. What became of it, none of us knew but none of us got any of it.
