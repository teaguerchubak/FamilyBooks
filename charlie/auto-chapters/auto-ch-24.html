                That winter was so wet and we waded in mud, ankle-deep. We had dry bunks to sleep in but there was nothing fancy about it. The place had dirt floors and was wide enough in the aisles for two rows of double bunk beds. There was about a three-foot space between them.

                The boys who became part of this company were from every division during wartime. And they had been sent to this hospital. It became almost impossible to return the boys to their own companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some companies or divisions had been sent back to the states and others were shifted about in Europe. My division, the 77th, was serving in Germany. I was placed in the 40th Div. in California. This was made up mostly from our own boys from the West. Yet this 40th was a replacement division for the 77th of New York. The records do not show this, so that is strange how the records were handled.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the boys were released from the hospitals they were sent to some embarkation camp called “Casuals.” In my case, when I left France, I was discharged from Cheyenne, Wyoming as a casual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our stay in Saint-Nazaire wasn't so bad. We had become full-fledged soldiers and were always looking for the soft spots. And we did our share of goldbricking — shunning all work whenever possible. Our detail work was easy. We were so close to the ocean we could hear the fog horns of those big ships as they entered and left. As for the rain, from a clear sky, clouds would rise from the ocean and then the rain would come down in torrents. No wonder those Frenchmen were called “Frogs.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Our biggest headache was standing inspection. We would take our packs out on the field and everything was spread out on the wet ground in the mud and rain. This happened about once a week. But once a week we stood inspection for Gen. Pershing. He was to view us on Monday, but he didn't arrive until Friday. And all those days of looking forward with dread was passed in a few moments. The general stopped before each soldier's wardrobe. We scarcely dared to take a breath, fearing that he might give us a compliment; maybe backwards, but again we escaped punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had stood at attention like marble statues during that time. And as he left for his car, a sigh of relief fell heavily from the boys. Then we returned to the barracks to resume our duties as goldbrickers. We tried to see who could outdo the others by not doing anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our work was easy and brought forth many a laugh. For example, we worked in pairs or in squads. About once a week our grounds were cleaned up, trash barrels emptied, loose papers raked up and loaded onto one of those old-fashioned dump carts. And the Frenchman, with his little burro, would move slowly along. It was amazing what those little beasts could do when they felt like it. But most of the time they would be much like the army boys; not a bit satisfied while working but always looking for the easy way out.
            </p>
            <p>
                We learned from this French driver such words as “giddup” and “whoa” in French. At least we learned enough for the donkey to understand us. And then the fun began. It wasn't much of a problem to stop the burro. A sneeze or cough would make him stop dead still. But to get him going again took brains! — French brains! We joined in with that French driver in our broken French, doing the best we could to get that donkey going. Then this Frenchman would get angry, turning towards us, with his arms high in the air, and laying down the law to us — I suppose! We didn't understand a word of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when he shuffled about, pointing fingers toward us as well as to the donkey, and stamping his feet, his story was translated thus: “You noisy Yankees, keep your mouths shut and let me do the driving.”
            </p>
            <p>
                And we had to heed his command, whatever it was. But that donkey business broke the ice and cheered us considerably.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is surprising what those little burros can do. I have seen just one hitched to a big boat, pulling the boat up the canal. There are many canals leading away from the ocean. They are man-made and not deep enough for ships to travel on their own power. So the burro was then substituted to do the work of gas motors or steam engines. They seemed to do it quite well. I have watched the tiny burro slowly pulling a large boat; whereas it would have taken a big motor of many horsepower to have moved it into deep water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before leaving France I had a little work to do. Once a week we took a small wagon down to the coal yard and brought back a week's supply of coal for our barracks. This was by manpower and about twenty men went on this detail. We had that ankle-deep mud well churned after that return trip. With all this manpower we could still take our time. We could spend all day if we wished, getting this job done. It was here that I suffered so badly through that arthritis attack and was excused from duty for two weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I had improved, I was given a job in the commissary. And I had this job until I sailed for the States. This was the best job throughout my war history. I was out of the rain. And best of all, working in that department, we had access to all the new outfits. I was always outfitted in my choice of the best of everything — shoes, hats, etc. And finally I was called to be ready for my trip back to the States.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a happy day for us who left on that ship. We were marched to the docks. And as the gangplank was lowered, we went aboard, much happier in mind than when we arrived. In less than one hour that boat was steaming out into the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of us stood on the deck in quietness without sound of band music, nor even a wave of the hand. This was much different from the way it was when we arrived in England. Yet our eyes must catch the last glimpse of the land for which we had suffered, and where many had died.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our boat ride home back to New York was made in a single ship — not in convoys. It was much quicker than when we crossed over. The sea was quiet. There were no torpedoes to watch. The only danger was from floating mines. But six months after the war, most of them had been gathered in. We were reminded of the follies of war by the boys who had been shell-shocked and were returned home.
            </p>
            <p>
                We docked in New York and there was a large welcoming crowd. Many people had taken time off from work to welcome us home. And bands played beautiful music and waving happy crowds of people lined the docks and streets. This brought forth much joy and happiness to us being welcomed back to our American home. Less than a year ago we were loaded from this same dock; but not this casual company.
