                We were loaded on box cars and rode all night and the next day. Then leaving the freight train, we walked all night. We were getting well up into the Argonne Forest before daybreak. And we billeted for three days in a fairly nice camp. We were tired and hungry. But this was to be our last rest before entering the front lines. We hadn't slept nor eaten anything for two days, except the hard tack we had in our packs. This was our first starvation period.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in these last days of freedom, we ate well and we had bunks to sleep in. We went through the delousing plant, as it was called, freeing us from cooties. Then we had a bath and clean uniform. Those three days became a short dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the darkness, again we moved ahead, but more cautiously than before. As we entered the crossroads between peace and war, we were stopped again. It was daybreak and I was called upon to take a detail to the field kitchen for food. This was a small link in landing in England and first days on the Western Front.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were about to get our first introduction into the real meaning of war. I have taken the short way in, and the long way out. But I believe one will get a better understanding that the foot soldier wasn't always in the 'pit of hell' but there were things of interest and not all good. We could hear the rifle shots so plain from the distance. And now and then a stray bullet would whiz over our heads. Before we had reached our company we had seen our first dead soldier — a German.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't long until we met with our company. We were given different positions which we held until the next morning. It was very difficult the first few days. In fact, how could anyone become accustomed to war?
            </p>
            <p>
                But let us drift a bit here; not as in that song, though, “Beautiful Ohio.” My wife-to-be, Valenia Dumas, had sent me the song. I received it in the front trenches many weeks or months later. It seemed I needed some encouragement at that time as there wasn't much to sing about. And in her letter it brought back memories of home and the loved ones left behind. It gave me more determination to do my best, get this war over so we could go home.
            </p>
            <p>
                And thinking of home made me think of Mother. She was so well educated; not altogether from school years, but with much knowledge stored in her mind. She read books. And she had talks with her brothers about their lessons. Uncles, two of them were studying for a doctor's degree. Her brothers were going to college and Mother helped them in the evenings. They were studying to be doctors and Mother knew every word. Her evenings were very full. Mother had also been a teacher of music, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                In war times anything is expected. But before Mother put the gold star in her window many things were to transpire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our clothing and shoes were turned in for more substantial outfit when we first arrived overseas. Shoes, uniform, and leggings were exchanged for yard-long wrap-around type. Army hats took the place of caps. And we put on “trench shoes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We, who worked in the commissary, could outfit ourselves as we liked. I chose old type army dress closely woven suit of broadcloth. Then came infantry-style hat with green braid around the crown. Our dress shoes in those days were called “russets.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In my new outfit as I took off for the canteen, and feeling well dressed, I was mistaken for an officer. The boys saluted me. I felt shaky so on my return trip I took a different route. I removed the cord from my hat. And that freed me from being mistaken for an officer. Many months later when I returned home, I had everything except the hat. That had been replaced for a cap.
