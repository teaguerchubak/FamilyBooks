                There were many things to think about, such as my survival. It was as we heard so often, “You were just plain lucky, or else your time wasn't up yet.” Many believed that. But those words don't satisfy my thoughts. I believe there were times when I was protected through some other source. A miracle could happen to a German. A miracle could also happen to an American. It leaves no question in my mind, that I, too, was protected many times from death; just as others were.
            </p>
            <p>
                Miracles happen in war as elsewhere at times, whether one believes in them previously or not. I remember a terrible night of shelling from cannon fire from two armies, and I with no protection. It stands out in my memory. There wasn't a foot of solid ground left anywhere. It was either blown up or covered up by flying dirt. Yet I walked out. Another time a lad and I were moving a wounded soldier under heavy gunfire for at least five or ten minutes time. Yet we got out without getting a wound.
            </p>
            <p>
                One time I was walking my post right out in the open. There was no protection except on each end of my beat. There was some clumps of brush there. All at once I heard gunfire. The shots were hitting all around me. I stopped dead still and turned toward the Germans. I emptied my gun in the same direction from which their fire seemed to be coming. There wasn't a soul in sight. The bullets were hitting all around me except in front of me. I couldn't understand this. I knew that if I should straighten either arm out it would be shot off. A step forward or backward and I would have been shot down. I just stood there sort of frozen, expecting any moment to drop dead. As their fire equaled to almost zero I turned and 'hit' for the brush. There were a few shots fired in my direction. But finally, I made my way back to the company commander.
            </p>
            <p>
                Has it really been forty-five years of time that has gone by since I was discharged from the army, 25th April 1919? That is unbelievable. But in mind only, let me take you back into that hospital with the big flaps for the doorway flung wide open, and tied. It was raining and a soft breeze was blowing about in that tent as I sat on my cot. I could see for miles even though most of the trees were cut off from eight or ten feet above ground due to the heavy shelling. But it brought out beauty; those rolling hills with green patches here and there which looked especially beautiful to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I lay on my cot I dared not let my thoughts dwell on those horrible days and years, even, of war. To be honest with you, in my thoughts I haven't left my bed. We are still struggling along by feet or yards in advance forward over this same ground. And as I lie here I will call this second heaven. I have been bedfast even though it's only my second day here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been told to stay in bed. It is all so wonderful! Can it be just a dream? Maybe we are the boys who fell in battle and those we saw dying, are amongst the living. It is really so confusing. As I look up I see a doctor coming toward my cot with a sheet of paper; another form to sign. Here he is now and he speaks in such a kind voice, saying,
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hi, soldier. How are you feeling today?”
            </p>
            <p>
                And I say, “Oh, just fine. Can I get up today?”
            </p>
            <p>
                And he answers with a little chuckle, “No, you could not walk on those kind of feet. Instead, we are sending you and two others to the base hospital tonight. This is if that French ambulance driver ever gets through.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sure enough, about twelve o'clock, midnight, we are hustled into that queer-looking ambulance. Here we go! It never rains but it pours, and quite true here, too. How we ever got through, should make history. As usual, it was a heavy downpour and a dark night. And who knows but what the German Army was close by with no lights. Maybe it is a twenty-mile trip over brush and shell holes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were doing the best we could under the circumstances when all of a sudden the wheels went over a high bump and then down into a deep hole. It was such a shakeup that it tore the top bed loose and down it came onto us two who were on the floor on stretchers. There we lay, two of us pinned down. I, with both feet bandaged, and the other with one arm blown off. The one on the top was minus a leg. He managed to draw the attention of the Frenchman to our plight by knocking his good foot against the glass window. We felt so thankful that the driver now knew of our plight and now we would get that load off from on top of us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The driver came to a stop. With much excited French talk which we didn't understand, we took to mean that we had to get out any way we could. So I, with bandaged feet, tho't I could stand. But when my feet couldn't hold my weight, I went head first with a bump. And the man who depended on crutches could only find one. He stood teetering with one crutch. And as I fell, I swept away his crutch, so down he came, too!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now the Frenchman did get excited! First, he had to clear out the wreckage. He let us just lie there. The stretcher was pitched out into the brush. There was no room for it. We three had to be crowded onto the floor and what a job that was getting us loaded into the ambulance. What a ride we had! At last, we came to our destination and we were so helpless we had to be carried. Finally, we were put on the waiting train.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things were different then. We were put to bed and fed and watered, meaning much the same as one would put a horse away for the night. These last two lines brought the first smile to my face since my war story began.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found that no one was being sent back from the front unless it was proved by different doctors that his condition was difficult, or serious enough to warrant medical care from the confines of a hospital. First, there was the dressing station to which we were taken, then the field hospital. I never knew until later why the delays meant so much to the army.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when one was sent to the base hospital, the meaning was that he had a 95% chance in his favor of never returning to the front. So with much shifting around, I had lost my company, division and all.
            </p>
            <p>
                So we settled down for most of the winter in that rainy muddy Saint-Nazaire awaiting transportation to the States.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this time I met a young man, let's call him Joe Chamberlain as I have forgotten his given name. But everyone in the army called him “Joe.” We were all called that, anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                This particular Joe was the son of the Gov. of Oregon. We chummed together at work, meals, or playing cards. Wherever one was, there went the other, except for this particular day. I had put in a sleepless night with the first attack of arthritis. I think throughout the years my suffering from it never equaled that night's hurt.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the morning I put my name on the sick list in the doctor's office. My friend, Joe, was given a moment's notice to catch the next boat and head for home. I suppose the boat was steaming out in the ocean before I left the doctor's office. I had only the sad memory of a hurried scribbled note left on my bed by that happy lad who was leaving for home. I don't remember the words, but he said he would see me in Oregon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later I gave that Oregon visit a thought; do I belong in that governor's home, even for one hour? No, I don't. I was just too quiet and bashful to have made a success of any trip like that. So I spent the winter routine months waiting my turn to get back to the States.
