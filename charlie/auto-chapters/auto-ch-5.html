                I was about fifteen years old now, I think, and the year 1907 when I went to work for a Mr. Johnson. As Mr. Johnson drove me to my new home I wondered how things would work out. Would this fill in the gap? He kept up enough talk for both of us as I was so full of thoughts I didn't do much talking except to answer his questions. Half the time I didn't understand what he was talking about in his Swedish brogue, and he would repeat it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We traveled light as in those days one didn't need trunks and suitcases. Everything at the home was furnished. My complete belongings were tucked into my pockets. And as we got near his home there was one thing I knew right off about him. It was so clear before us; his team, harness, buggy, and all in good shape. Nothing was left undone that I could see. I noticed the barn, yard, and house, so neat and well-kept. It seemed a model farm home. And the bunkhouse took my attention. The ride was a short seven or eight-mile drive, and we arrived about supper time. I thought if we didn't get along it would be my fault only; not his.
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw they were a nice family with three boys, and the oldest one was two or three years younger than I. And Mr. Johnson seemed to have three different names; Bill, Swede, and Sweet.
            </p>
            <p>
                My eyes became big as saucers as we went into supper. The table in the kitchen ran almost the full length of the house. It was loaded with steaming platters; different types of meats, vegetables cooked in many ways, and fruits, cakes, and pies! I never before had seen anything like this. It didn't just happen once, oh, no. I was there several years and that was the way we ate every day, winter and summer. I had always heard that the way to a man's heart was through his stomach. But who can say when one becomes a man? The way to a boy's heart is through his desire for plenty of food; I found that out even as a boy. The food was fine, and it wasn't bad working for Mr. Johnson.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those long winter months of sub-zero weather in So. Eastern Idaho were now losing as mother nature was now taking over. The drifts in shady places were disappearing. Old man winter had done his duty and it was time for general spring clean up. We were starting to work in this beautiful spring after months of very cold weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found we were getting along fine. Work and chores were finished and supper was over. We had plenty time left before dark to do fun things, like our daily swim in the slough. This wound its way through Mr. Johnson's place.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were those yearling cattle needing riding; at least we thought so. We got down the lariat and lasso and spent many hours on that sport on the ones we thought would do the most bucking.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those days no boy was content without a gun. And among us boys we had many. Mr. Johnson furnished all the shells that we used. There were many ducks. With those and the sage hens in flocks of ten to twenty, we had plenty of shooting. There were no game laws then. And there were rabbits by the thousands. We practiced shooting and hunting in all our spare hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone in town or country worked six days a week. Then on Sunday church took up a big part of the day. Mrs. Johnson was a very religious woman. They lived seven or eight miles from church. Regardless of the weather, winter and summer, all the year through, we hitched up the team. We went to church in that buckboard two-seated buggy. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson would not agree on the trip on the worst blizzard Sundays. But to her that Sunday ride to church was a law.
            </p>
            <p>
                Church didn't take up much of our time though. And we boys were free for a day or more at a time during rainy days during the summer months. The fields would be too wet for working so we were left to do as we pleased. That's when we went hunting. We brought back fowls, feathers, and all. We had done our job, so Mrs. Johnson took over from there.
            </p>
            <p>
                We boys drove into town almost every Saturday night. Most of the stores kept open until midnight. Between window shopping and shows, we were busy for the evening. Sometimes we bought things; like shoes, candy, and soft drinks. Mr. Johnson was thoughtful of us boys. He would reach down into his pocket and pull out five dollars and say, “Here, boys, have a good time.” This would happen about the time we were leaving for town and he made this a habit about twice a month. We never left town until all that money was spent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Show tickets only cost ten cents, or vaudeville, twenty cents. It sounds impossible that three boys could spend five dollars. But other than for shows, we spent the rest of the money on whatever we needed, like gloves or three pr. of socks. And we took up the whole evening on these pleasures and then would head for home and be in bed about 2:00 AM.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Sunday we complained about being awakened at the peep of the day by a loud rap, rap, rap, or a kick on the door. Then the call outside the door of “everybody up” was heard. And we had to get up this earlier than weekday call to get ready for church. I had got in the habit of calling Mr. Johnson, “Bill.” Bill had the job of waking us boys each morning. We depended upon that knock through the years. And we didn't mind except Sundays; how we would have loved having a little more shut-eye. But his faithful knocking did away with the alarm clock.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone was a little cranky on Sundays. But Bill was doubly cranky. The first hour of the morning didn't set very well with him. He did the milking. This meant that he was alone with his grouch, and the cows. We boys were busy with other morning chores. His grouch happened regularly every morning, but especially Sunday mornings. But by the time the breakfast was ready, the fog had cleared away; then until bedtime one could not have been around more sunshine than he could pass out.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was the best-natured man I ever worked for, except for that early Sunday morning hour. He had been a heavy drinker at one time until his wife put her foot down. I suppose on those early morning risings the thought would enter his mind, “If only the bottle were handy” but it never was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bill ran his ranch with the efficiency of a bank president at his job. Nothing was left undone. There were sheds for all the machinery. And sheds and barns housed the livestock. Everything was kept in order and repaired as needed; in fact, no machine was put under cover until it was checked, oiled, and painted. The harnesses were taken into Blackfoot for repairs and oiled. Everything had to be perfect for next spring work. I know that nothing was left undone.
