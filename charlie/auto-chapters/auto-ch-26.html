                In the spring of 1946, I was sent to Helena, Montana, by the Government of U.S. Vets, for a fitting of shoes. My feet were so badly injured by trench feet during the Army term that I needed special shoes. My orders were to report to one of the biggest shoe stores in the city. After trying on about a dozen pairs in different sizes the clerk gave up. I was handed a letter addressed to a doctor at the hospital. It was then the Veterans Adm. found that it was necessary to have my shoes made to order.

                The first pair was made by a shoemaker in Missoula, Montana. He tried to fit my feet but with little success. Another pair was made in Butte. And each pair cost twenty dollars, plus my transportation. It was decided that I must have casts made of my feet, and I was to be sent to Denver. I could either travel by train or take my own car. If by car, I was given the same mile rate as the railroads charged, so I decided to drive my car.

                My old Buick was well-battered after about ten years of hard use. And I was told by a neighbor that it would be foolish for me to drive that old car through to Denver. But at that time my choice was limited. As usual, my finances were far below that of our expenses. I just had one hundred dollars which was enough to get by not figuring any car trouble or delays. We have always heard “Never look for trouble because troubles look for you.” And so we didn't look for it and troubles hit us. But there hadn't been any choice except to drive my car.

                It was decided that Keith, 12 years of age, and Steven, 10, would accompany me to Denver. There wasn't any choice except to drive the aged, battered, and worn-out 1935 vintage Buick; train fare was too expensive.

                In use, our car was like one of the family. One would use almost every word under the sun to describe his hatred towards all motor vehicles, and then burst forth with praises, not for the newer cars, but for those older ones now junked, from Buick to Model-T Fords. But it does give me pleasant thoughts we had toward those old models, even though I had to reinforce ours at times with haywire.

                The boys were so thrilled to be excused from the remaining days of school. It was early May and the teacher gave permission for the boys to leave school before vacation time. Their grades were good and they were given promotions and could leave for this trip with me.
