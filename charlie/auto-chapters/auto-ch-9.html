                After my arrival in Blackfoot, I knew my summer clothing was no match for that 20° below temp. I always arrived anywhere short of cash; this was no exception. I sat in the depot wondering what to do — walk out just as I was with my shotgun, or walk a few blocks to a dry goods store, pick out some much-needed cold weather clothing, and leave my gun for security. At first, the clerk didn't like that deal. But after explaining that within a short time I would be working for the Parrish brothers, and the clerk knew them so well. So he let me walk about with the clothes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Parrish home was several miles East of Blackfoot. The wind had drifted the snow and the tumbleweeds were blown against the fences holding the snow high on the roads. The fields on the other side were bare of snow.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was cold, but I was prepared for any weather as I walked out of the store with laced boots, two pair wool socks, a pair of mittens, and two pair of warm underwear. Things were cheap and a dollar was worth a dollar. But dollars were hard to get, but at two dollars a day wages, and board, those were high wages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within a few days we were at work on the ice ponds as preparations had already been made for the work of cutting the ice. Ed and I had decided to batch it for the rest of the winter. He owned forty acres of land which took in the ice pond. We settled down to work hard at this job.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was about half through my ice job when my luck turned. I came down with the Mumps. I was home-bound for a week or ten days. I sure was sick at the wrong time. But I had earned enough to pay my store bill and was able to reclaim my gun.
            </p>
            <p>
                The winters in Blackfoot are so long, and outside the ice job there is nothing to do except haul wood. The wood hauling job for red cedar, for instance, is West of Blackfoot on the lava beds. Working there one has to be very careful on account of the deep holes and cracks. The volcano of hundreds of years ago left an eruption of thousands of acres of molten lava. It looked like a sponge when covered with snow but is a trap for man and beast.
            </p>
            <p>
                These lava beds have caused broken bones and even death during the years. I knew of one man hauling wood alone, stepped into a crevice or crack, and was wedged in so tight he couldn't free himself. When found, he was dead. So my time there was always with a crew; neighbors got together to get out wood, and others hauled it home.
            </p>
            <p>
                In those days it wasn't the land of plenty. But there was always someone who put life in the party and kept things running. There was friendliness and good humor no matter how long were the hours. On the farms it meant a ten-hour day even in the fields, plus one hour of chores morning and evening. But after supper, we were ready to go again. There were hours of daylight in the long summer months for work. Then there were hours of sports, swimming, or games of horseshoe. And every boy wanted to be a bronco rider. If there was a horse that would buck, there was always one who tried his luck on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And every farm of any size had a bunk house. The boys of the family and any hired help had a room to himself. After meals, all the boys over the age of ten left the table and went outside. They never sat in the front rooms; they scarcely knew what any room besides the kitchen looked like.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the lady folks, having the house free of lounging men must have been a relief. Women seldom smoked as they had no desire to lower themselves to that filthy habit. Smoking was meant for men, they believed. This solved the problem for years of men at a table, lighting up and smoking and then knocking off the ashes into his plate. It just didn't happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                We failed in one respect, though. We left the table without waiting for the other, and without excusing himself. I failed in many ways in the niceties of life, being around men so much of the time. But men were considered the masters of the outside world and also in their homes.
