                Time had gone by and any of us who could walk were to walk toward the Field Hospital and receive aid. Some of us could scarcely hold body and soul together, but we were supposed to get to the hospital the best we could. They had moved it as close to the front as was safe. This hospital consisted of tents, beds, and whatever was needed for us; we, of the Lost Battalion.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had walked and walked and at last arrived at the field hospital. And those who had passed out were picked up later. What a wonderful welcome we received from Gen. Johnson of the 77th Division. Yes, there's that name again — “Johnson.” He hadn't stopped the march to give a speech. But he talked to the boys as they passed by. We were starved, thirsty, and worn out. We were put to bed in our old dirty grimy uniforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                That field hospital seemed like heaven to us when we entered it, even to the attending personnel. They became angels. So the difference between heaven and hell became note-worthy. Gen. Johnson spoke and he meant every word he spoke: “Boys, your sufferings, hardships, and bravery will go down in history.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, how I wish I had the memory to write down now his speech. I remember how thrilled we were to be here and listening to him, and of being where we could get some help.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though I had had such a short distance to walk, my steps had seemed lighter. My whole soul seemed lifted. Now we knew we hadn't been forgotten as we thought we had. Somebody cared! I felt that they care so much that if a call for reinforcements were made, I would try to get back in again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone was so kind and understanding. They gave us more to think about; how are our dear folks at home? We had heard that many in the states had died of flu. Were we to arrive home to find our homes broken from death of some? Many did!
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though our tired souls had been released of gun and ammunition, we were carrying a heavy load. It would take much time to heal the wound! So, in thought only, the best thing to do was to forget the whole thing and concentrate on getting well. And this helped; our shoes were removed. We received food and water — but not much, though. Then came the doctors. They were hard hit, too. This isn't yesterday, but years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I have been thinking; mulling over these events in my mind. My whole soul had such feelings of joy and happiness on that day of rescue! And those other boys were in as much, or more pain than I. I know I am speaking their thoughts, too. And as we lay in that hurry-up make-shift field hospital, we were almost speechless for two days. One could have heard the drop of a pin. But what was there to talk about? — not war, surely not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our ghost-like forms lay on our bunks. We got that name, “ghost-like,” from one of the attendants who said that every time he entered this tent he felt so spooky-like. He did his best to cheer us but with little success. But those silent hours weren't spent in vain. Our minds were busy. One never knew what would happen next in this man's army. Maybe tomorrow there might be an emergency to get us back on the front lines. Where there is life, there is hope, too — that we should never again enter this war. But one never knows how long this war will keep up.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so I, like many others, was lucky enough to hold ourselves together almost to the last breath. We could not have kept alive another week with no food nor water. It seems there is no better way to explain war than to say “heaven or hell.” Yes, I have been in hell, but how close to heaven, I don't know. As we move closer to the better things in life we are moving closer to heaven. But so many war days were spent deep down in the center of hell and nothing less!
