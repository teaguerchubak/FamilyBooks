                The whole thing started the 18th of September 1892, the day I was born. I just bet that day was a Friday. I have tried to find a famous person born on that date and year but failed to find one mentioned. Paul Revere's ride was on the 19th, but the month was April 1775. So that does not count. How about Jesse James? Shall I consider him? He was up and going, and all his doings and failures happened during my time. But perhaps I should skip him and go on with my story.

                I was christened Charles Frederick Johnson. Let us talk about the name "Johnson." I suppose most of the Johnson family take well to that name because we have "an edge" over most names. During World War I, the name "Johnson" appeared on the records as the second or third most common name. I think it was either "Jones" or "Smith" who took first place.

                My mother, Electa Melvina Stevenson, was the first child born to Edward Stevenson and Emily Electa Williams Stevenson. She was born 23 January 1858 in Salt Lake City, Utah. When she was almost seventeen years old she married George Manwaring, 26 October 1874.

                There were seven children born to this family: Harold, being the last, born 11 February 1889 in Big Cottonwood. Then the husband and father, George Manwaring died 7 July 1889. Mother, being a very young widow of 31 1/2 years of age, married again, 18 October 1891, John Johnson. He was born in Denmark about 1841. When Mother was married to him they lived in Riverton, Utah, where I was born the 18 of September 1892. Mother was all alone when I was born, she said. This marriage was unsatisfactory and they were divorced.

                Mother was left with no means of support so Harold and I, being the youngest, were left in the care of Grandmother Stevenson down in Cottonwood much of the time.

                There was a land boom in those days in Idaho and Mother went there to file her claim on a homestead. Whenever it was possible, Mother took us boys with her. I was so young, but I remember those days as though they were yesterday.

                I was a little fellow and I'm sure I did my share of crying when we were left at grandmother's home. But I doubt that anyone ever caught me crying. Mother was one of those down-to-earth farm women and even built the house in which she lived. I was told that the city of Aberdeen was built on Mother's land. Years later I knew Mother had sold the homestead. There are many things I remember of our days in Idaho.

                I remember also so many things about our lives spent in Cottonwood; the dairy house, and the bridge across the Cottonwood Creek. There were ponds and running streams and crystal clear springs where many trout played. And there were frogs by the hundreds. The weather in the valley was perfect, long summer months with very hot days and warm nights. The climate was ideal for the growing of flowers.new
