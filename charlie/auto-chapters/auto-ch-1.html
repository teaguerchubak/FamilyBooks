                The whole thing started the 18th of September 1892, the day I was born. I just bet that day was a Friday. I have tried to find a famous person born on that date and year but failed to find one mentioned. Paul Revere's ride was on the 19th, but the month was April 1775. So that does not count. How about Jesse James? Shall I consider him? He was up and going, and all his doings and failures happened during my time. But perhaps I should skip him and go on with my story.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was christened Charles Frederick Johnson. Let us talk about the name “Johnson.” I suppose most of the Johnson family take well to that name because we have “an edge” over most names. During World War 1, the name “Johnson” appeared on the records as the second or third most common name. I think it was either “Jones” or “Smith” who took first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                My mother, Electa Melvina Stevenson, was the first child born to Edward Stevenson and Emily Electa Williams Stevenson. She was born 23 January 1858 in Salt Lake City, Utah. When she was almost seventeen years old she married George Manwaring, 26 October 1874.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were seven children born to this family: Harold, being the last, born 11 February 1889 in Big Cottonwood. Then the husband and father, George Manwaring died 7 July 1889. Mother, being a very young widow of 31 ½ years of age, married again, 18 October 1891, John Johnson. He was born in Denmark about 1841. When Mother was married to him they lived in Riverton, Utah, where I was born the 18 of September 1892. Mother was all alone when I was born, she said. This marriage was unsatisfactory and they were divorced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mother was left with no means of support so Harold and I, being the youngest, were left in the care of Grandmother Stevenson down in Cottonwood much of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a land boom in those days in Idaho and Mother went there to file her claim on a homestead. Whenever it was possible, Mother took us boys with her. I was so young, but I remember those days as though they were yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was a tender-hearted little fellow and I'm sure I did my share of crying when we were left at grandmother's home. But I doubt that anyone ever caught me crying. Mother was one of those down-to-earth farm women and even built the house in which she lived. I was told that the city of Aberdeen was built on Mother's land. Years later I knew Mother had sold the homestead. There are many things I remember of our days in Idaho.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember also so many things about our lives spent in Cottonwood; the dairy house, and the bridge across the Cottonwood Creek. There were ponds and running streams and crystal clear springs where many trout played. And there were frogs by the hundreds. The weather in the valley was perfect, long summer months with very hot days and warm nights. The climate was ideal for the growing of flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                And for children at play, it was perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
            As dusk settled over this productive valley, nighttime brought happiness as the voices of frogs rang out until morning. As children, we loved the music of frogs and when that symphony of night sounds came to an end, the birds took up with their calls from one tree to another. It was beautiful and inspiring to me, young as I was.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another early remembrance was when I owned a doll. I know little boys like to play with dolls, but that is “out” because of the kidding he would get from big brothers. I guess dolls never were meant for boys as I found out the hard way.
            </p>
            <p>
            I may have been six years old when I became the owner of a doll for a short time. I used to go to the country store for Grandma. I would see that doll in all her beauty, so pretty in face and dress. I couldn't keep my eyes off that doll. I even dreamed about that doll.
            </p>
            <p>
            Everything was so cheap at that time, but I never had any money, not even a penny. I thought about it and wondered where I got the money for that beautiful doll. Then it all came clear to me in my mind. My father, John Johnson, came from Salt Lake and took me to town. He bought me a suit, shoes, and shirt. In fact, I had a whole new outfit. Then he gave m five dollars. I bought that beautiful doll. I never, ever, would have had the money for it as I never did get over five cents for some errand. And I always spent that for candy.
            </p>
            <p>
            But that doll — how I loved her! I had a hide-away up in the hay loft above the cow barn. I used to spend all my time playing with that doll, but for such a short time.
            </p>
            <p>
            How grandma or Aunt Hattie ever found out about that doll, is beyond me. I was so secretive about her. But Aunt Hattie started out so skillfully, saying,
            </p>
            <p>
            “I know by now, Charlie, that you bought that nice big doll for Vera. It was nice of you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            And all I could say was, “Yes, ma'am.”
            </p>
            <p>
            But my whole heart and soul was crushed. I loved that doll so much. I took such tender care of her. I shed many tears over parting with that beautiful doll. But there was not one thing I could do except hand it to Aunt Hattie. I felt so lost and forlorn. I used to go out to the hay loft when I knew no one was watching. And how tenderly I had tucked her into the hay neatly dug out for her bed. As darkness came, it wasn't long before it was my bedtime; then I would climb those long stairs. And I would kneel down by my bed and say a prayer that the good Lord would take care of my doll through that dark night.
            </p>
            <p>
            We were brought up to pray. We really believed our prayers would be answered. Happy thoughts would surround me — then to know that they had been shattered! As I write this, there is a faint heartache even today as I think back over those many years gone by. But today as I think back, I know that Aunt Hattie did the right thing, and in such a lady-like way. Vera was a little baby. No doubt Aunt Hattie saved it until Vera grew up a little. None of the neighbor kiddies ever heard about it, so how lucky I was! In those days a boy had to become a man right off! — not a sissy as I had been!
            </p>
            <p>
            Many times I have asked Josephine to be sure the children have a good Christmas with presents enough to go around. That is very important. As a child, I never remember any little toys being handed to me, except by my Aunt Lizzie who was Mother's half-sister. She had married Dr. Fred Wilcox, whose given name was Charles Frederick Wilcox. Mother said she named me after him. Mother had taken me to their home several times. One time my cousins gave me a big salt sack full of beautiful marbles. This aunt and her children were thoughtful in the way she treated us. She would give Mother the outgrown clothes of her children, Mother could make them over. And Aunt Lizzie used to send money to Mother occasionally.
            </p>
            <p>
            I don't understand why Mother should have been in such dire need. The Stevensons were very well-to-do. But perhaps they had more land than anything else. It could have been that the sons were the only ones who were the heirs. If so, this left the daughters to depend upon their marriages for support.
            </p>
            <p>
            Grandpa Stevenson was wealthy in those days in land and money. But he died in 1897. Grandma seemed to have no spending money. She sold some of their eggs to have pin money. Grandpa Stevenson was a wonderful preacher, being one of the First Seven Presidents of Seventy. He had been on so many missions and paid his own expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
            Grandpa Stevenson was born 1 May 1820 in Gibraltar, Spain. He came to America with his parents. He married Emily Electa Williams 20 April 1857. She had been born 23 September 1841 in Zarahemla, Lee Co, Iowa. She died 21 September 1918. He had died 27 January 1897.
            </p>
            <p>
            Grandma was only sixteen when she married Grandpa and they had a large family of sons and daughters. With all her work there was much to do in that large family of children. But she was also Relief Society President for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I think back to conditions then, I am not sure why Mother never had anything. As for presents at Christmas, they were so few I may as well say there were none. But perhaps I don't remember all the circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
            For years I believed in Santa Claus. One Christmas evening before going to bed at grandma's, Harold and I hung our stockings by the kitchen stairs. At home with Mother we had a little Christmas; very little, but we always looked forward to something. Harold was doubtful about Santa coming to Cottonwood. But not I. I knew my stocking would be filled. He surely would not pass up that big white house!
            </p>
            <p>
            I was so excited I could scarcely wait until eight o'clock as that was the earliest I could come downstairs. Many times I walked down the stairs to look at that big clock. Eight o'clock, and sure enough, Santa had been there. Our stockings were full! But in a moment my happy thoughts turned to tears. My uncles had played a trick on us. They had nothing with which to put in the stockings, so they filled them with small pieces of coal!
            </p>
            <p>
            But Christmas brought some joy to my young heart. In the other Stevenson families where there were children, things were much different. They had toys, guns, and sleds. And I had the opportunity of seeing and playing with Harry Stevenson's presents. He was my cousin and my best friend. And he was so kind and unselfish even to the candy and goodies. He always shared his things with me. My mother spent much of her time in Idaho. But at Christmas — I wonder where my mother was. Surely she wouldn't be there in the cold winter. I have forgotten; perhaps she was working somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
            One time when I was very young and we were left at grandma's, mother carried me upstairs to bed. She must have been leaving for Idaho for a while. Maybe it was just for a day or two. But she tucked me into bed and kissed me good-bye. As she neared the stairway, she blew out the lamp. As she disappeared, and I heard her footsteps going down the stairs, it seemed my whole heart and soul was broken. I cried and cried; not in a mean way, but deep down in my little body. I don't know how old I was, but from that parting, I felt more hurts and disappointments than at any other time in my childhood days.
            </p>
            <p>
            I had other problems, too. A few months later Aunt Hattie took me to the outdoor toilet which in those days was called a “privy.” Aunty was close somewhere, but the only thing I have in mind is that I was too small for the seat. Moments later I was sitting down in that deep hole. I guess I made plenty of racket and it wasn't long before I was out of there.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another time some of the older children had brought me to the barn to see the cows being milked. My uncle had a big dairy. The trough was down one side and the other. I didn't stay long as the children left me, thinking I was safe, no doubt. They were running back and forth and I got the bright idea of trying my legs. And I landed head-first in the trough.
            </p>
            <p>
            These last two incidents are so foolish that I surely must have been only one or two years old. But it makes me feel within myself a very little pride; not a great pride. But I am glad I can remember back to those early years and it is fun recalling them.
            </p>
            <p>
            My cherished memory was the trips I took up to Idaho. One time we went by train and other times by team and covered wagon. One time mother was taking us children on the train to Idaho. The conductor let us off miles from the house, way past our station and into the desert. There we stood with bag and baggage beside the track. We started to walk. I marched ahead like a little man or soldier. But Maude grew tired and lay down and kicked and squalled, using mother's word, “squalled.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, we could go no farther and we spent the night in a man's barn lying in the hay. Afterwards, when we came back for our baggage there was a great snake curled upon the bedding. And one time Mother walked a quarter of a mile over a railroad trestle with the Snake River underneath.
            </p>
            <p>
            I recall one train trip when the train had stopped at a side track to let another train pass, or maybe it was just a stop. However, one of the trainmen came through and picked me up and carried me up to the engine. I was really frightened, not with the man, but of that big black hissing monster. It seems to me I rode the engine to the next stop. Railroads at that time were not new, neither were they old. They got us there, at least. They were made up mostly of freight cars with a passenger coach in between. I'm not joking, but one had to be almost a cowboy to ride them.
            </p>
            <p>
            There were no restrictions on what baggage one took, so long as one could carry it. We took the cat along with us one time. And getting off the train at Twin Falls, we expected to get a ride with the mailman. Somehow we had missed him. You can guess what we did; — just walked, bundles, cat, and all. We walked on and on through daylight and way into the night. And through this wild desert area, nothing survived except jackrabbits and rattlesnakes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Houses were miles apart. I lightened our load, though. I had been carrying the cat. And when we stopped for a rest, I opened the box and out jumped the cat! You have heard that saying about letting the cat out of the bag. For me, that was the real thing. I bet there were plenty of bad things said about me, but I don't remember.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mother was a very sweet, understanding, jolly little lady. I can't remember that she ever spanked us kids; not that we didn't need it. But it just didn't happen. Maybe it was because in her childhood she was brought up by a very strict father and mother.
            </p>
            <p>
            She was of such a happy disposition. She was always singing in the early morning. And her get-up time was 4:00 A.M. The teapot was boiling and in a short time she was enjoying her cup of tea. Even though we were poor, it was wonderful in Mother's homestead. This was a few miles from a little burg called Tilden.
            </p>
            <p>
            We had a hard life up there with little variety. But we had Mother with us and that was beautiful. We were children and children love to be with their mother, wherever that is. The place isn't important. There were a number of children for us to play with. We got along very well. Mother and the old folks up there visited back and forth; our nearest neighbors being the Grovers.
            </p>
            <p>
            One time my hair was getting long. Mother begged and prayed for me to let her cut my hair. But no, not for me; no woman was ever going to cut my hair. So, instead of a stick in one hand and scissors in the other, she gave in. Just the same my hair was cut by a woman, and not by my mother. Mrs. Grover cut it and it had been well planned. The next time we were visiting the Grovers, I got on the chair at her bidding, behaved like a little man, and off came my long edge of hair. There is always a way out and even today I envy her in her kindness and thoughtfulness.
            </p>
            <p>
            The only way we could have lived through those hard years was because we lived near these wonderful neighbors. We had run out of flour one time. And mother said, “Boys, go over to Mrs. Grover and borrow some flour.” I had to toddle along; no wonder I now have such a hard time walking today.
            </p>
            <p>
            But we didn't come home with the flour. My brothers, Will and Harold decided to play a trick on Mother. As we neared the cabin, Will put me in the sack, the sack over his shoulders, and walked into the house. He put the sack down in the corner, saying, “Here, mother, is your flour.” And out jumped me — little Charlie. I don't know how old I was, but to fit in the sack I must have been a bit on the baby size.
            </p>
            <p>
            Even to this day, I don't understand how we lived through the danger in which we were confronted. There were hundreds of rattlesnakes. One day a big rattler was coiled up in the corner of the house. There were many things with which mother contended. She just got the broom and swept it right out of the house. And there were poison woodticks, too.
            </p>
            <p>
            The fishing trips would scare one today. But we braved them and went to the Snake River to fish. There were hundreds of rattlesnakes there. But that was our fishing point. I don't remember that I fished, but I was always along.
            </p>
            <p>
            For our livelihood, we lived on fish, hotcakes, and rabbits. We ate rabbit when we ran out of flour. When there was no fish, we ate rabbit. But with our bad eating habits, none of us were ever sick. We were very blessed. The only medicine we ever took was salts, and always a good helping of sagebrush tea.
            </p>
            <p>
            As I look back over those years there were wonderful days of rough and tumble, but hardships, too. But if I had my choice today, a mansion and gold on one hand, and the rugged years we boys and mother spent, I surely would choose the latter. Best of all we were united and tagged along with Mother whenever we could. One of the most beautiful thoughts a child has is his mother. And we had our mother. She was there with us.
            </p>
            <p>
            My sister, May, missed all those wonderful years. She had been ten years old when her father died. So she stayed in Cottonwood under the care of her uncle and aunt and helped to tend the children and helped in the house. A sweet lady-like little girl.
            </p>
            <p>
            May would have loved being with us. I remember one trip with many horses and wagons. These were called wagon trains. One was never alone on these trains as after the first day's drive, we would meet another wagon. There were many Indians but they weren't mean. As I look back I wonder if those terrible days of massacre between whites and Indians was only in the minds of older people. Maybe this is why they chose the wagon train way of traveling. Yet at my young age, I can't remember all of our experiences. But a few things come to mind — our horses were “Billy” and “Prince.” They were a good old team. How or where they spent their last days has faded from my memory.
            </p>
            <p>
            But I do remember the nights we camped, as there never was a dull moment. There were plenty of children to play with. And as darkness spread its blanket over the hills and sagebrush valleys, a big campfire was built. And what a lot of fun we kids had. The men and boys would drag in the sagebrush.
            </p>
            <p>
            We gathered around the campfire and listened to talented music players. But we had such fun playing we weren't too happy to stop our play. But we did stop as we liked the music. And we lined up with the older folks and we sang, or tried to. We always had another day of play. One time a large number of Indians stopped to take in the show. I don't remember being afraid. Mother was there. And without her tender care, our survival here on earth would be small. So the very least I can say is <em>God bless them all.</em>
