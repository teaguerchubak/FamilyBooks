                It must have been midnight when all at once it seemed the world was being torn apart. Our big guns had opened fire. But through some mistake or misjudgment, they were shelling us! The shells were falling short. Then the Germans got their big guns in motion. There we were, just a few hundred men, taking a beating from two armies. It seemed like a vise tightening slowly about us. Death seemed almost certain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to stop my trips as the ground was being blown up. There was no place to go for protection. One was just as safe one place as another. Finally, I worked my way back to the trench. There was no life anywhere. Instead of getting down in the trench, I did some loud calling, but no answer. Then I knelt in the trench, lowered my gun, and hanging onto the barrel, worked my way along for about ten or twenty feet. But I failed to find either life or death. There was just no one! I sat down for a moment wondering what to do — where to go. I still had that deep dread of being buried in France, alive or dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I decided to take off over that same trail that I had become used to during that long night. But this time I went on my hands and knees as it was impossible to stand up and walk. Those tall willows and green bushes of yesterday were uprooted and strewn about. Only deep shell holes were left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those army wool suits were heavy when sopping with water. I was soaked to the skin. I slowly pushed myself back a short distance from the trench. Then I was stopped by uprooted trees and clumps of brush. I had to be satisfied by just lying down on the ground which was bumpy, muddy, and rain-soaked.
            </p>
            <p>
                I stretched out on my back just waiting; waiting for what? Surely not for death! Maybe the impossible might happen though the odds were against me. I could dig myself out. Or if a direct hit was made, I might drag to safety whatever part of my body that was left. I would have done it, too. I was that determined!
            </p>
            <p>
                What a night of horror! My thoughts would have filled a good-sized book. Who was responsible for us being here in a foreign land? Those who started this should be forced to shoot it out among themselves. Then there would be no wars. But as we were told — <em>THIS WAR WAS TO END ALL WARS</em> — well, maybe that did make sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                In between shots of shell, my mind would pick up thoughts of home. If home, where would I be at this time of night? Even a straw stack for a bed would be heaven!
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I settled down to the more serious thoughts of life — my survival, for instance. Where are the men — those few who were here last night? Were they all buried alive in that trench? Were they captured or were they moved back to safer ground? There was nothing to do but wait until daylight for the answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then just as suddenly as the barrage from our guns had started, it stopped! At last word had gotten through to the artillery. It wasn't long until the guns were raised again and the heavy attack started. This time it landed directly on a small town across this formerly beautiful shell-swept valley nestled against other low-sweeping foothills; numerous throughout the woods. Then the German guns were silenced. This long night was coming to an end. Daylight was showing. What hopes lie ahead for this new day! First I must find what happened to my company.
