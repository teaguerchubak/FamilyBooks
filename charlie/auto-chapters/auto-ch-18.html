                I began to move about, cautiously. I edged up behind a large clump of willows which had been uprooted during the night. This gave me some protection while I looked about.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seemed that sometime after the shooting began, all the Germans had left. Everything seemed safe after the shelling. But the busy cove along the river afforded me no protection. I made for the trench, not knowing the Germans had machine guns in the trees. We were surrounded, although I didn't know that there was a German anywhere within shooting distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I looked up and down the trench. There were piles of dirt blasted into it by our own big guns. But there were no signs of any soldiers! What should I do? It was too dangerous working oneself back from the front. As I stood there wondering what to do, an officer walked by. He spoke up, saying, “Would you take ten men up the river?” I stood there, speechless, but only for a moment. Then a bit of orneryness seemed to enter my soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                But before I could speak, this man had left. After all, I knew this wasn't an order, only a privilege. If it had been a demand, I would have used all my strength to fulfill that important job. As it was, I knew my answer would have been NO.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had spent a horrible night from that heavy shelling. My eyes were swollen from flying dirt. At one time I had been almost knocked over. My feet were swollen and bleeding; too proud to give up, yet I was too weak to carry on. I had drawn on my excess strength much the same as a strong rope being worn down to the last strand.
            </p>
            <p>
                There seemed only one choice; either hang on to my already worn-out soul and body, or slump down with the best protection I could find from shell fire, and wait for death; some did!
            </p>
            <p>
                As this lieutenant left, I sat down and watched him disappear. This gave me a rest. I tried to free myself from mud and dirt that I had collected during the night. My back felt like a grindstone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I stood up and decided to go in the same direction that this officer had taken. However, I kept closer to this rolling hill. As I walked along, I stumbled into a big shell hole. And to my great surprise, about a dozen men were crouched down in that hole. Was I scared! They were too! I thought they were Germans and they thought I was one! They swung around with all their guns pointed towards me as I hit bottom. The only word spoken was from the officer, who said, <em>“OH!”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                They were all ready to attack a machine gun which was hidden in a tree some distance up a hill. I had never seen these men before, nor the officers. The men I knew and the remnant of my company were gone, but where?? I'll never know. So at this time, I became a soldier without a company.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a wonder I hadn't been shot, because in most groups of soldiers there is a trigger-happy guy. Well, I settled down with the officer, and I believe he was Maj. Whittlesey, himself. He was the man who had led us into this situation. Yet it was unusual seeing an officer of such high standing as a major at the front lines. But this lost battalion wasn't tailor-made. It just happened. The major got us into it and he had to fight his way out just as the rest of us did.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just stood there; then settled myself down in the shell hole. But he ordered his men up that hill. They were about halfway up when all at once the machine gun turned fire on them! The shots were hitting all around us. This officer was hit on the head. The wound seemed trivial but it took a while to get the blood to clot. I helped bandage it. He took it all good-naturedly. This surprised me as he had not taken anything else that way, but had used every curse word under the sun when he ordered the men up the hill. It was done with a violence that shook the ground. It put such fear into me that I stood there almost hypnotized expecting any moment to be ordered up the hill. I waited and waited but that word was not spoken. The shell fire only lasted about a half hour and this officer waited for at least some of his men to return, but not one came back. So he just got up and left. I watched him walk in the same direction the other one did. It seemed they were headed back from the front. I thought some of the men from my company might show up so I just sat down and rested. I had eaten the last of my hardtack yesterday. It had been weeks since any of us had eaten anything but army hardtack or sole leather hard biscuits. How long can one go without eating, I wondered. But as I sat there, I fell asleep. It was the first time I had had this opportunity of sleeping for weeks.
