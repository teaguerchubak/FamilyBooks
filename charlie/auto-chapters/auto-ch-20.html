                As I stood in that trench so well protected by brush and big trees, I got the full meaning why I escaped death the day before. The distance between where I stood and the trench was at least a half mile. This clearing, or meadow, was free of brush.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was out in the open, facing the enemy and the bullets whistled just inches from my body. Directly in front, there was no shot. It was those big trees along the trench that protected me. And I ask myself, why did I choose to stand facing the enemy right in the open to be shot down? Why not take the natural course and run for the thicket which was only yards away? Why did I stand there? This wasn't a sign of bravery.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I had run, there was grave danger of being shot down. But ordinarily one would take the chance of running, and perhaps dying, rather than standing still and be shot. But on this occasion, it seemed different. I wasn't thinking at all. I wasn't even frightened. I cannot honestly say why these things happened; just accept it. And it proved beyond a doubt that one is guided to a great extent in war, or in peace. It makes no difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's not accept the thought that our protections and happiness are just plain luck. Nor should we settle in our minds that sickness, disappointments, or other miserable things should be expected in life. We should not think we should always expect the worst in life, either. That is not true nor the answer to one's problems. We must seek a higher source, either by prayer or thought with prayer and determination and diligence accepting the truth and the knowledge that God is our protector.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another part of this war that has caused me much thought is that I had broken the rules of war in a moment and let a man live! It was hard to understand myself. Why did I let him live? At first, I felt disgusted; was I fit to handle such a responsible job as a guard? I had disobeyed the rule of war, but not of God. I do not know that my failure to shoot is worthy of mention. But it has brought me a better understanding, happiness, and satisfaction throughout my war history. A flash of light, a burst of shell could have meant a broken home, an orphaned family, sorrow, and grief. All this could have been shattered by the slight pull of the trigger and that was what I had been trained to do. But whenever I needed help, either then or now, it has been provided; not by myself alone, but through a higher source which I didn't understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been a “doubting Thomas” all my life, and still am. But when things have been proved more than once, I must accept and believe that a higher power sometimes “steps in” and we do the right thing. Why was I given these honorable moments of conversion?
            </p>
            <p>
                I have reference to my brother, Harold. We were both in the woods, but not together. On his last mission, I had got the full meaning and understanding of his spiritual self.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I stood by that lone tree in line of duty, not in a daze, though, I had the feeling that I was being guided and lifted to a higher sphere; only for moments. But it was just long enough to get the full meaning why he appeared to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can truthfully say that these were the most beautiful moments of my entire life. While the meaning of all this was centered deep down within my inner self, I can never forget it. I wasn't altogether satisfied, though, and doubts entered. I would have to wait until I arrived home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote to my brother, George, after I arrived home in Blackfoot, Idaho. I didn't explain anything. And in a short time I received a letter from him. He insisted that I come to Salt Lake City and be sure to come and see him first. He had some very important news to tell me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sat down and answered. These were the first letters I had received or answered since the actual meeting time of my brother, Harold. I stood by and received the words in understanding that he, Harold, had left his earthly body. So in my return letter to George I said, “If that important news that you are holding for me has anything to do with Harold's death, it won't be news to me. I have known this from the very day, or maybe the very moment he died.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Through future correspondence, that important bit of news being held until I arrived in Salt Lake City was just as I thought. It was to inform me of the sad news about Harold's death in the woods. Again my doubts had been proven; they were no longer doubts. I never before had had such an experience. Why this seemingly unbelievable miracle could happen to me is fruitless to explain, especially to non-believers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many times I have insisted that I must be shown in order to believe. In comparison, let's take water-witching as an example to sort of show up my theory. Yet our earthly life compared with our spiritual form of life is so different. Nor is water-witching or a vision comparable with one who can 'witch' for water.
            </p>
            <p>
                It does carry within oneself a feeling of responsibility and the desire to accomplish a worthwhile job, depending entirely on the stick for a guide. The depths of the earth to those water gussets are not known. But the willow or a chosen stick, handled by the right person will not fail. It's not everyone who can get results from water-witching. I don't know why unless it depends on the electricity which one carries through his body.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience throughout the war gives me the honest right to believe in things that I know are true and worthy of mention. It matters little whether others accept it or not, but with me, it can never be destroyed. These things shall linger throughout my life. And as in death, shall bring happiness and comfort to me. I need no proof. In water-witching, there is no proof, either, until the water comes gushing through the faucets.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have great faith both in visions and water-witching because they have stood the test. These are the facts and truth even though my comparisons are picked through two different fields and entirely separate natures. There seems to be a little relationship connected, though. In our spiritual sense, one only sees but cannot touch. I would call that a miracle. In water-witching one does not see but goes by the sense of touch.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the appearance of my brother, Harold, it all seemed so natural, seeing him. Instead of feeling sad, I felt relieved and encouraged, knowing that death meant peace. I knew the struggle for life's existence was over for him. Those painful moments or maybe even hours were too much to bear. And on that late afternoon life had departed. At that very moment, he appeared in my presence a contented, smiling youth who had given his all to his beloved country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today his body rests in that flag-draped grave in the family plot in Salt Lake City, Utah — a symbol to all America, including those thousands of other boys who were called to meet their Maker.
            </p>
            <p>
                We, who lived to walk the gangplank and set foot on American soil, can only in memory replace in thoughts, those many soldier boys right from our own company who would never return home. But they are silently sleeping in our National Cemetery in Flanders Field. And Lieut. Col. John McCrae expressed the words that I could not when he wrote that beautiful poem that he called:
            </p>
            <p class="poem">
                IN FLANDERS FIELDS<br>
                In Flanders Fields the poppies blow<br>
                Between the crosses, row on row,<br>
                That mark our place; and in the sky<br>
                The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br>
                Scarce heard amid the guns below.<br><br>

                We are dead. Short days ago<br>
                We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br>
                Loved and were loved, and now we lie<br>
                In Flanders Fields.<br><br>

                Take up our quarrel with the foe;<br>
                To you from failing hands we throw<br>
                The torch; be yours to hold it high.<br>
                If ye break faith with us who die,<br>
                We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br>
                In Flanders Fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                (And John McCrae died in France January 28, 1918, after four years of service on the Western Front.)
            </p>
            <p>
                With these words, I pay tribute to my brother, Private Harold Manwaring, of the 8th Machine Gun Battalion C-5, U.S.M.C. He was buried in grave #301 in American Expeditionary Forces Cemetery, #86, on October 17, 1918, in Mesves, France.
            </p>
            <p>
                His body was later brought home to Mother and the family and buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. My sister, May Lillie received a letter dated May 5, 1919 from:
            </p>
            <p class="poem">
                Headquarters, Mesves Hospital Center,<br>
                France. A.P.C. No. 708<br><br>

                Mrs. May E. Lillie,<br>
                947 Dresden Ave.<br>
                Salt Lake City, Utah.<br><br>

                Dear Madam:<br>
                This letter will inform you that your brother, Private Harold Manwaring, 8th Machine Gun Battalion, C.5 U.S.M.C. who died in this center on October 16, 1918 was buried in Grave No. 301 in American Expeditionary Forces Cemetery No. 86, at this place, on October 17, 1918. There is attached hereto a small photograph showing a section of the cemetery in which he is buried, which will show you the manner in which the remains of your loved one are being cared for in France.<br><br>

                On Sunday, April 27, 1919, an official dedication of this cemetery was held, and there is enclosed in this letter a copy of the programme which was carried out on that day in honor of the brave men and women who gave their lives in the service of our country, and who are now resting at Mesves Hospital Center.<br><br>

                You may rest assured that the graves of these fallen heroes which have been so carefully prepared and appropriately and fittingly dedicated, will constantly be watched over with tenderest care throughout the future years.<br><br>

                Yours very truly, signed<br>
                Edgar A. Bocock,<br>
                Major, Medicat Corps.<br>
                Commanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flanders Fields is a resting place of beauty amid those acres and acres of graves nestled among those white headstones. But even through the dark nights, the poppies stand guard and represent life. Throughout this flowering kingdom, they never falter nor fail. But they seem content to grow and grow, bringing cheer and hope to those families who visit their sons' graves. It has been said that enough tears have been shed to have watered a good-sized flower garden, each year. This cemetery is kept up by our government in memory of the boys who fell in battle over many miles of the Western Front.
