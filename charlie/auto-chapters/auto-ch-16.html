                When it became time for the officer to say to us, “We are at war now,” we didn't feel a bit happy, and neither did the officer.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Follow this trench to the end,” he said to us. “Then there will be a clearing with no trench. Keep well apart. Run as fast as you can and free yourselves of packs as you run. You will come to another trench. Get down in it and run until you meet the company.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Those seemingly endless days came and went like an angry beast clawing at one's throat. Were we to go through this hell only to be shot down at any moment, ending our precious thoughts of home, and the land we loved?
            </p>
            <p>
                But there wasn't one of us who dared to think of death and being buried in a desolate spot such as a foreign land. And above all, not in the front-line trenches. My determination to live seemed to outweigh that seemingly grasp of death which hovered so close to us. There were so many of my dear buddies who were shot down and they had wanted to live just as much as I.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back over those days it seemed more like being a spirit walking among the dead rather than being a well-armed soldier. We looked like shadows more than human beings because of the hardships of war; sleepless nights and days without food nor water. And it was beginning to show its effects too. Those ghostly black nights and endless days, and nights of rain did not help.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes it was a relief to hear the sergeant call, “It's your turn to take up guard duty.” It was to clamber out of that muddy wet shellhole or trench, soaked to the bone, just to enter a cleaner soaking. And so we spent our allotted time of two hours walking his post — if he lived that long!
            </p>
            <p>
                There was plenty of shooting even through the darkest night as I remember back to that time in 1918. We had advanced a short distance which put us within a hundred feet from the Muse Argonne River. There was a clearing between us and the river. But on either side, there was a thicket. The German Army had retreated, except for a number that was left behind and they were well protected. But our advance put us out in the open except for a long deep trench which was overfilled with soldiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those next twenty hours were a nightmare with neither rest nor sleep, except for those who had gone to meet his Maker. And we who survived, pushed forward as darkness settled over 'no man's land' on that gloomy evening. We had been warned, <em>NO SMOKING, NO TALKING, NO COUGHING.</em> These orders were carried out except for the coughing. Everyone coughed. But we understood by these warnings that we were in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was now dark, and safe to stand erect without being a target for the Germans. As I stood up I noticed some object stooped over and walking along the trench. It was the lieutenant. He gave me a tap on the shoulder and said in a low voice, “Come up; it's guard duty.” As I reached the top, he told me to sit down and he explained my duty as guard; trips back and forth from this point to almost the bank of the river. He asked, “Can you take it?” In a flash I said, “I can.” None of us were safe. We were just as safe one spot or another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lieutenant told me that our artillery was putting on a barrage which could take place any moment. Then a reminder — always open fire whenever we were fired upon either night or day. And we were to fire two shots to every one they fired. We had been told this so often that it was the natural thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was really dark now and raining hard this late October. By this time I think all of the boys were used to the rain as well as to the cooties. One could not drown them, neither could they be smothered by our heavy laden muddy uniforms. Maybe these little biting garments were a godsend. At least they kept our bodies in motion.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we stood up our whispers ended with these words, “Watch your step. You will be relieved in two hours.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be all alone now. The night was dark and I must get my bearings from other sources. If I ever needed help in my war days, I needed it then. It seemed that I had all the odds against me. I was carrying a big responsibility and if I failed it, my whole company could be wiped out. I must get through it some way. My beat was about a city block long. And how could I get through? Only by the sound of the river.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hours before we had descended a rolling hill and my thoughts settled on that. I thought if I walked upon the bottom, it would be my guide. It wasn't long before my trips were made. I had my bearings now. We were just a stone's throw from the Germans. At the end of my beat, I could have reached out and shaken hands with a dozen of them. That would have been the best way to settle matters but was not to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                The far ends of my trips were the danger points. I could hear the coughs and quiet voices of those entrenched Germans. And I could almost feel the sting — almost — of a pierced bayonet entering my chest or being overpowered and captured. If it hadn't been for the heavy rains that night my most cautious tread would have been heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those miserable hours passed. When would I be released? Hours went by. Nothing seemed certain. Had I been forgotten? I had no watch.
